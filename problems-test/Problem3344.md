Given a positive integer s, let A be a 3D array of dimensions n × n × n, where each element A[i][j][k] is defined as:

A[i][j][k] = i * (j OR k), where 0 <= i, j, k < n.

Return the maximum possible value of n such that the sum of all elements in array A does not exceed s.
 
Example 1:

Input: s = 10
Output: 2
Explanation:

Elements of the array A for n = 2:

A[0][0][0] = 0 * (0 OR 0) = 0
A[0][0][1] = 0 * (0 OR 1) = 0
A[0][1][0] = 0 * (1 OR 0) = 0
A[0][1][1] = 0 * (1 OR 1) = 0
A[1][0][0] = 1 * (0 OR 0) = 0
A[1][0][1] = 1 * (0 OR 1) = 1
A[1][1][0] = 1 * (1 OR 0) = 1
A[1][1][1] = 1 * (1 OR 1) = 1


The total sum of the elements in array A is 3, which does not exceed 10, so the maximum possible value of n is 2.


Example 2:

Input: s = 0
Output: 1
Explanation:

Elements of the array A for n = 1:

	
A[0][0][0] = 0 * (0 OR 0) = 0


The total sum of the elements in array A is 0, which does not exceed 0, so the maximum possible value of n is 1.


 
Constraints:

0 <= s <= 1015
