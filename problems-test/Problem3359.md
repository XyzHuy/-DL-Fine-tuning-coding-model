You are given a 2D matrix grid of size m x n. You are also given a non-negative integer k.
Return the number of submatrices of grid that satisfy the following conditions:

The maximum element in the submatrix less than or equal to k.
Each row in the submatrix is sorted in non-increasing order.

A submatrix (x1, y1, x2, y2) is a matrix that forms by choosing all cells grid[x][y] where x1 <= x <= x2 and y1 <= y <= y2.
 
Example 1:

Input: grid = [[4,3,2,1],[8,7,6,1]], k = 3
Output: 8
Explanation:

The 8 submatrices are:

[[1]]
[[1]]
[[2,1]]
[[3,2,1]]
[[1],[1]]
[[2]]
[[3]]
[[3,2]]


Example 2:

Input: grid = [[1,1,1],[1,1,1],[1,1,1]], k = 1
Output: 36
Explanation:
There are 36 submatrices of grid. All submatrices have their maximum element equal to 1.

Example 3:

Input: grid = [[1]], k = 1
Output: 1

 
Constraints:

1 <= m == grid.length <= 103
1 <= n == grid[i].length <= 103
1 <= grid[i][j] <= 109
1 <= k <= 109
