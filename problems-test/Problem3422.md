You are given an integer array nums and an integer k. You can perform the following operation any number of times:

Increase or decrease any element of nums by 1.

Return the minimum number of operations required to ensure that at least one subarray of size k in nums has all elements equal.
 
Example 1:

Input: nums = [4,-3,2,1,-4,6], k = 3
Output: 5
Explanation:

Use 4 operations to add 4 to nums[1]. The resulting array is [4, 1, 2, 1, -4, 6].
Use 1 operation to subtract 1 from nums[2]. The resulting array is [4, 1, 1, 1, -4, 6].
The array now contains a subarray [1, 1, 1] of size k = 3 with all elements equal. Hence, the answer is 5.


Example 2:

Input: nums = [-2,-2,3,1,4], k = 2
Output: 0
Explanation:


The subarray [-2, -2] of size k = 2 already contains all equal elements, so no operations are needed. Hence, the answer is 0.



 
Constraints:

2 <= nums.length <= 105
-106 <= nums[i] <= 106
2 <= k <= nums.length


Boilerplate code:
```python
def minOperations(nums, k):
    ...
```
