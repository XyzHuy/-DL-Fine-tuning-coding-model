Given an array nums, return the number of subsequences with an odd sum of elements.
Since the answer may be very large, return it modulo 109 + 7.
 
Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,1,1]
Output: 4
Explanation:
The odd-sum subsequences are: [1, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1].

Example 2:

Input: nums = [1,2,2]
Output: 4
Explanation:
The odd-sum subsequences are: [1, 2, 2], [1, 2, 2], [1, 2, 2], [1, 2, 2].

 
Constraints:

1 <= nums.length <= 105
1 <= nums[i] <= 109


Boilerplate code:
```python
def subsequenceCount(nums):
    ...
```
