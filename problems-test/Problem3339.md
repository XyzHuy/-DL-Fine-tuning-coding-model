You are given three integers n, m, and k.
An array arr is called k-even if there are exactly k indices such that, for each of these indices i (0 <= i < n - 1):

(arr[i] * arr[i + 1]) - arr[i] - arr[i + 1] is even.

Return the number of possible k-even arrays of size n where all elements are in the range [1, m].
Since the answer may be very large, return it modulo 109 + 7.
 
Example 1:

Input: n = 3, m = 4, k = 2
Output: 8
Explanation:
The 8 possible 2-even arrays are:

[2, 2, 2]
[2, 2, 4]
[2, 4, 2]
[2, 4, 4]
[4, 2, 2]
[4, 2, 4]
[4, 4, 2]
[4, 4, 4]


Example 2:

Input: n = 5, m = 1, k = 0
Output: 1
Explanation:
The only 0-even array is [1, 1, 1, 1, 1].

Example 3:

Input: n = 7, m = 7, k = 5
Output: 5832

 
Constraints:

1 <= n <= 750
0 <= k <= n - 1
1 <= m <= 1000


Boilerplate code:
```python
def countOfArrays(n, m, k):
    ...
```
