You are given two strings s and t.
Return the length of the longest common prefix between s and t after removing at most one character from s.
Note: s can be left without any removal.
 
Example 1:

Input: s = "madxa", t = "madam"
Output: 4
Explanation:
Removing s[3] from s results in "mada", which has a longest common prefix of length 4 with t.

Example 2:

Input: s = "leetcode", t = "eetcode"
Output: 7
Explanation:
Removing s[0] from s results in "eetcode", which matches t.

Example 3:

Input: s = "one", t = "one"
Output: 3
Explanation:
No removal is needed.

Example 4:

Input: s = "a", t = "b"
Output: 0
Explanation:
s and t cannot have a common prefix.

 
Constraints:

1 <= s.length <= 105
1 <= t.length <= 105
s and t contain only lowercase English letters.


Boilerplate code:
```python
def longestCommonPrefix(s, t):
    ...
```
