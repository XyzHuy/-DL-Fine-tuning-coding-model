Given an array of integers nums, you are allowed to perform the following operation any number of times:

Remove a strictly increasing subsequence from the array.

Your task is to find the minimum number of operations required to make the array empty.
 
Example 1:

Input: nums = [5,3,1,4,2]
Output: 3
Explanation:
We remove subsequences [1, 2], [3, 4], [5].

Example 2:

Input: nums = [1,2,3,4,5]
Output: 1

Example 3:

Input: nums = [5,4,3,2,1]
Output: 5

 
Constraints:

1 <= nums.length <= 105
1 <= nums[i] <= 105


Boilerplate code:
```python
def minOperations(nums):
    ...
```
