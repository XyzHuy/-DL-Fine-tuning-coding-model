You have an infinite number of coins with values 1, 2, and 6, and only 2 coins with value 4.
Given an integer n, return the number of ways to make the sum of n with the coins you have.
Since the answer may be very large, return it modulo 109 + 7.
Note that the order of the coins doesn't matter and [2, 2, 3] is the same as [2, 3, 2].
 
Example 1:

Input: n = 4
Output: 4
Explanation:
Here are the four combinations: [1, 1, 1, 1], [1, 1, 2], [2, 2], [4].

Example 2:

Input: n = 12
Output: 22
Explanation:
Note that [4, 4, 4] is not a valid combination since we cannot use 4 three times.

Example 3:

Input: n = 5
Output: 4
Explanation:
Here are the four combinations: [1, 1, 1, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1, 2], [1, 2, 2], [1, 4].

 
Constraints:

1 <= n <= 105


Boilerplate code:
```python
def numberOfWays(n):
    ...
```
