A bus has n stops numbered from 0 to n - 1 that form a circle. We know the distance between all pairs of neighboring stops where distance[i] is the distance between the stops number i and (i + 1) % n.\r
\r
The bus goes along both directions i.e. clockwise and counterclockwise.\r
\r
Return the shortest distance between the given start and destination stops.\r
\r
 \r
Example 1:\r
\r
\r
\r
\r
Input: distance = [1,2,3,4], start = 0, destination = 1\r
Output: 1\r
Explanation: Distance between 0 and 1 is 1 or 9, minimum is 1.\r
\r
 \r
\r
Example 2:\r
\r
\r
\r
\r
Input: distance = [1,2,3,4], start = 0, destination = 2\r
Output: 3\r
Explanation: Distance between 0 and 2 is 3 or 7, minimum is 3.\r
\r
\r
 \r
\r
Example 3:\r
\r
\r
\r
\r
Input: distance = [1,2,3,4], start = 0, destination = 3\r
Output: 4\r
Explanation: Distance between 0 and 3 is 6 or 4, minimum is 4.\r
\r
\r
 \r
Constraints:\r
\r
\r
	1 <= n <= 10^4\r
	distance.length == n\r
	0 <= start, destination < n\r
	0 <= distance[i] <= 10^4\r

Boilerplate code:
```python

    ...
