You are given two strings word1 and word2. Merge the strings by adding letters in alternating order, starting with word1. If a string is longer than the other, append the additional letters onto the end of the merged string.\r
\r
Return the merged string.\r
\r
 \r
Example 1:\r
\r
\r
Input: word1 = "abc", word2 = "pqr"\r
Output: "apbqcr"\r
Explanation: The merged string will be merged as so:\r
word1:  a   b   c\r
word2:    p   q   r\r
merged: a p b q c r\r
\r
\r
Example 2:\r
\r
\r
Input: word1 = "ab", word2 = "pqrs"\r
Output: "apbqrs"\r
Explanation: Notice that as word2 is longer, "rs" is appended to the end.\r
word1:  a   b \r
word2:    p   q   r   s\r
merged: a p b q   r   s\r
\r
\r
Example 3:\r
\r
\r
Input: word1 = "abcd", word2 = "pq"\r
Output: "apbqcd"\r
Explanation: Notice that as word1 is longer, "cd" is appended to the end.\r
word1:  a   b   c   d\r
word2:    p   q \r
merged: a p b q c   d\r
\r
\r
 \r
Constraints:\r
\r
\r
	1 <= word1.length, word2.length <= 100\r
	word1 and word2 consist of lowercase English letters.\r

Boilerplate code:
```python
def mergeAlternately(word1, word2):
    ...
```
