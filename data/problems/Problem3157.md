Given the root of a binary tree root where each node has a value, return the level of the tree that has the minimum sum of values among all the levels (in case of a tie, return the lowest level).
Note that the root of the tree is at level 1 and the level of any other node is its distance from the root + 1.
 
Example 1:

Input: root = [50,6,2,30,80,7]
Output: 2
Explanation:


Example 2:

Input: root = [36,17,10,null,null,24]
Output: 3
Explanation:


Example 3:

Input: root = [5,null,5,null,5]
Output: 1
Explanation:


 
Constraints:

The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [1, 105].
1 <= Node.val <= 109


Boilerplate code:
```python
def minimumLevel(root):
    ...
```
