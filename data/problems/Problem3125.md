Given an integer n, return the maximum integer x such that x <= n, and the bitwise AND of all the numbers in the range [x, n] is 0.
 
Example 1:

Input: n = 7
Output: 3
Explanation:
The bitwise AND of [6, 7] is 6.
The bitwise AND of [5, 6, 7] is 4.
The bitwise AND of [4, 5, 6, 7] is 4.
The bitwise AND of [3, 4, 5, 6, 7] is 0.

Example 2:

Input: n = 9
Output: 7
Explanation:
The bitwise AND of [7, 8, 9] is 0.

Example 3:

Input: n = 17
Output: 15
Explanation:
The bitwise AND of [15, 16, 17] is 0.

 
Constraints:

1 <= n <= 1015


Boilerplate code:
```python
def maxNumber(n):
    ...
```
