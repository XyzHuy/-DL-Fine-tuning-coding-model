Given the roots of two binary trees p and q, write a function to check if they are the same or not.
Two binary trees are considered the same if they are structurally identical, and the nodes have the same value.
 
Example 1:

Input: p = [1,2,3], q = [1,2,3]
Output: true

Example 2:

Input: p = [1,2], q = [1,null,2]
Output: false

Example 3:

Input: p = [1,2,1], q = [1,1,2]
Output: false

 
Constraints:

The number of nodes in both trees is in the range [0, 100].
-104 <= Node.val <= 104


Boilerplate code:
```python
# Definition for a binary tree node.
class TreeNode(object):
    def __init__(self, x):
        self.val = x
        self.left = None
        self.right = None

def isSameTree(p, q):
    ...
```
