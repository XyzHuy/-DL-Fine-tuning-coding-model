You are given a string road, consisting only of characters "x" and ".", where each "x" denotes a pothole and each "." denotes a smooth road, and an integer budget.
In one repair operation, you can repair n consecutive potholes for a price of n + 1.
Return the maximum number of potholes that can be fixed such that the sum of the prices of all of the fixes doesn't go over the given budget.
 
Example 1:

Input: road = "..", budget = 5
Output: 0
Explanation:
There are no potholes to be fixed.

Example 2:

Input: road = "..xxxxx", budget = 4
Output: 3
Explanation:
We fix the first three potholes (they are consecutive). The budget needed for this task is 3 + 1 = 4.

Example 3:

Input: road = "x.x.xxx...x", budget = 14
Output: 6
Explanation:
We can fix all the potholes. The total cost would be (1 + 1) + (1 + 1) + (3 + 1) + (1 + 1) = 10 which is within our budget of 14.

 
Constraints:

1 <= road.length <= 105
1 <= budget <= 105 + 1
road consists only of characters '.' and 'x'.


Boilerplate code:
```python
def maxPotholes(road, budget):
    ...
```
