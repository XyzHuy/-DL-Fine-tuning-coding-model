We call a string s of even length n an anti-palindrome if for each index 0 <= i < n, s[i] != s[n - i - 1].
Given a string s, your task is to make s an anti-palindrome by doing any number of operations (including zero).
In one operation, you can select two characters from s and swap them.
Return the resulting string. If multiple strings meet the conditions, return the lexicographically smallest one. If it can't be made into an anti-palindrome, return "-1".
 
Example 1:

Input: s = "abca"
Output: "aabc"
Explanation:
"aabc" is an anti-palindrome string since s[0] != s[3] and s[1] != s[2]. Also, it is a rearrangement of "abca".

Example 2:

Input: s = "abba"
Output: "aabb"
Explanation:
"aabb" is an anti-palindrome string since s[0] != s[3] and s[1] != s[2]. Also, it is a rearrangement of "abba".

Example 3:

Input: s = "cccd"
Output: "-1"
Explanation:
You can see that no matter how you rearrange the characters of "cccd", either s[0] == s[3] or s[1] == s[2]. So it can not form an anti-palindrome string.

 
Constraints:

2 <= s.length <= 105
s.length % 2 == 0
s consists only of lowercase English letters.


Boilerplate code:
```python
def makeAntiPalindrome(s):
    ...
```
