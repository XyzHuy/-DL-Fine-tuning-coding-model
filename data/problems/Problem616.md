You are given a string s and an array of strings words.
You should add a closed pair of bold tag  and  to wrap the substrings in s that exist in words.

If two such substrings overlap, you should wrap them together with only one pair of closed bold-tag.
If two substrings wrapped by bold tags are consecutive, you should combine them.

Return s after adding the bold tags.
 
Example 1:

Input: s = "abcxyz123", words = ["abc","123"]
Output: "abcxyz123"
Explanation: The two strings of words are substrings of s as following: "abcxyz123".
We add  before each substring and  after each substring.

Example 2:

Input: s = "aaabbb", words = ["aa","b"]
Output: "aaabbb"
Explanation: 
"aa" appears as a substring two times: "aaabbb" and "aaabbb".
"b" appears as a substring three times: "aaabbb", "aaabbb", and "aaabbb".
We add  before each substring and  after each substring: "aaabbb".
Since the first two 's overlap, we merge them: "aaabbb".
Since now the four 's are consecutive, we merge them: "aaabbb".

 
Constraints:

1 <= s.length <= 1000
0 <= words.length <= 100
1 <= words[i].length <= 1000
s and words[i] consist of English letters and digits.
All the values of words are unique.

 
Note: This question is the same as 758. Bold Words in String.

Boilerplate code:
```python
def addBoldTag(s, words):
