Given 2 integers n and start. Your task is return any permutation p of (0,1,2.....,2^n -1) such that :\r
\r
\r
	p[0] = start\r
	p[i] and p[i+1] differ by only one bit in their binary representation.\r
	p[0] and p[2^n -1] must also differ by only one bit in their binary representation.\r
\r
\r
 \r
Example 1:\r
\r
\r
Input: n = 2, start = 3\r
Output: [3,2,0,1]\r
Explanation: The binary representation of the permutation is (11,10,00,01). \r
All the adjacent element differ by one bit. Another valid permutation is [3,1,0,2]\r
\r
\r
Example 2:\r
\r
\r
Input: n = 3, start = 2\r
Output: [2,6,7,5,4,0,1,3]\r
Explanation: The binary representation of the permutation is (010,110,111,101,100,000,001,011).\r
\r
\r
 \r
Constraints:\r
\r
\r
	1 <= n <= 16\r
	0 <= start < 2 ^ n\r

Boilerplate code:
```python
def circularPermutation(n, start):
    ...
```
