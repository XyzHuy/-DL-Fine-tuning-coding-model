Given an array nums, return the maximum value of a triplet (i, j, k) such that i < j < k and nums[i] < nums[j] < nums[k].
The value of a triplet (i, j, k) is nums[i] - nums[j] + nums[k].

 

 
Example 1: 

Input:  nums = [5,6,9] 
Output:  8 
Explanation:  We only have one choice for an increasing triplet and that is choosing all three elements. The value of this triplet would be 5 - 6 + 9 = 8.

Example 2: 

Input:  nums = [1,5,3,6] 
Output:  4 
Explanation:  There are only two increasing triplets:
(0, 1, 3): The value of this triplet is nums[0] - nums[1] + nums[3] = 1 - 5 + 6 = 2.
(0, 2, 3): The value of this triplet is nums[0] - nums[2] + nums[3] = 1 - 3 + 6 = 4.
Thus the answer would be 4.

 
Constraints:

3 <= nums.length <= 105
1 <= nums[i] <= 109
The input is generated such that at least one triplet meets the given condition.


Boilerplate code:
```python

    ...
