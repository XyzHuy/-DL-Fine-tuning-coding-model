The alternating sum of a 0-indexed array is defined as the sum of the elements at even indices minus the sum of the elements at odd indices.\r
\r
\r
	For example, the alternating sum of [4,2,5,3] is (4 + 5) - (2 + 3) = 4.\r
\r
\r
Given an array nums, return the maximum alternating sum of any subsequence of nums (after reindexing the elements of the subsequence).\r
\r
\r
\r
\r
A subsequence of an array is a new array generated from the original array by deleting some elements (possibly none) without changing the remaining elements' relative order. For example, [2,7,4] is a subsequence of [4,2,3,7,2,1,4] (the underlined elements), while [2,4,2] is not.\r
\r
 \r
Example 1:\r
\r
\r
Input: nums = [4,2,5,3]\r
Output: 7\r
Explanation: It is optimal to choose the subsequence [4,2,5] with alternating sum (4 + 5) - 2 = 7.\r
\r
\r
Example 2:\r
\r
\r
Input: nums = [5,6,7,8]\r
Output: 8\r
Explanation: It is optimal to choose the subsequence [8] with alternating sum 8.\r
\r
\r
Example 3:\r
\r
\r
Input: nums = [6,2,1,2,4,5]\r
Output: 10\r
Explanation: It is optimal to choose the subsequence [6,1,5] with alternating sum (6 + 5) - 1 = 10.\r
\r
\r
 \r
Constraints:\r
\r
\r
	1 <= nums.length <= 105\r
	1 <= nums[i] <= 105\r

Boilerplate code:
```python
