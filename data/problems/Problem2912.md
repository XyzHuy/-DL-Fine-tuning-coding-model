You are given two integers n and m which represent the size of a 1-indexed grid. You are also given an integer k, a 1-indexed integer array source and a 1-indexed integer array dest, where source and dest are in the form [x, y] representing a cell on the given grid.
You can move through the grid in the following way:

You can go from cell [x1, y1] to cell [x2, y2] if either x1 == x2 or y1 == y2.
Note that you can't move to the cell you are already in e.g. x1 == x2 and y1 == y2.

Return the number of ways you can reach dest from source by moving through the grid exactly k times.
Since the answer may be very large, return it modulo 109 + 7.
 
Example 1:

Input: n = 3, m = 2, k = 2, source = [1,1], dest = [2,2]
Output: 2
Explanation: There are 2 possible sequences of reaching [2,2] from [1,1]:
- [1,1] -> [1,2] -> [2,2]
- [1,1] -> [2,1] -> [2,2]

Example 2:

Input: n = 3, m = 4, k = 3, source = [1,2], dest = [2,3]
Output: 9
Explanation: There are 9 possible sequences of reaching [2,3] from [1,2]:
- [1,2] -> [1,1] -> [1,3] -> [2,3]
- [1,2] -> [1,1] -> [2,1] -> [2,3]
- [1,2] -> [1,3] -> [3,3] -> [2,3]
- [1,2] -> [1,4] -> [1,3] -> [2,3]
- [1,2] -> [1,4] -> [2,4] -> [2,3]
- [1,2] -> [2,2] -> [2,1] -> [2,3]
- [1,2] -> [2,2] -> [2,4] -> [2,3]
- [1,2] -> [3,2] -> [2,2] -> [2,3]
- [1,2] -> [3,2] -> [3,3] -> [2,3]

 
Constraints:

2 <= n, m <= 109
1 <= k <= 105
source.length == dest.length == 2
1 <= source[1], dest[1] <= n
1 <= source[2], dest[2] <= m


Boilerplate code:
```python
def numberOfWays(n, m, k, source, dest):
    ...
```
