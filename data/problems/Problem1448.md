Given a binary tree root, a node X in the tree is named good if in the path from root to X there are no nodes with a value greater than X.\r
\r
Return the number of good nodes in the binary tree.\r
\r
 \r
Example 1:\r
\r
\r
\r
\r
Input: root = [3,1,4,3,null,1,5]\r
Output: 4\r
Explanation: Nodes in blue are good.\r
Root Node (3) is always a good node.\r
Node 4 -> (3,4) is the maximum value in the path starting from the root.\r
Node 5 -> (3,4,5) is the maximum value in the path\r
Node 3 -> (3,1,3) is the maximum value in the path.\r
\r
Example 2:\r
\r
\r
\r
\r
Input: root = [3,3,null,4,2]\r
Output: 3\r
Explanation: Node 2 -> (3, 3, 2) is not good, because "3" is higher than it.\r
\r
Example 3:\r
\r
\r
Input: root = [1]\r
Output: 1\r
Explanation: Root is considered as good.\r
\r
 \r
Constraints:\r
\r
\r
	The number of nodes in the binary tree is in the range [1, 10^5].\r
	Each node's value is between [-10^4, 10^4].\r

Boilerplate code:
```python
def goodNodes(root):
    ...
```
