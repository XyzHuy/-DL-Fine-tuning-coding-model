1. Problem summary: Calculate the XOR sum of a list formed by the bitwise AND of every pair of elements from two given arrays.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Bitwise operations, mathematical property of XOR and AND.
3. Step-by-step approach: Calculate the XOR sum of all elements in arr1. Calculate the XOR sum of all elements in arr2. The final answer is the bitwise AND of these two XOR sums.
4. Edge cases: Arrays can have lengths of 1. Elements are non-negative integers.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(N + M) where N and M are lengths of arr1 and arr2. Space complexity is O(1).
