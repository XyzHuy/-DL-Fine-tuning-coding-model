1. Problem summary: Partition a string `s` into `k` substrings to minimize the total letter changes required to make each substring a semi-palindrome.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Dynamic Programming, String manipulation, Optimization.
3. Step-by-step approach: Define a helper function to calculate minimum changes for a substring to be a semi-palindrome by iterating through all valid divisors `d` and checking palindromic groups. Use dynamic programming where `dp[i][j]` stores the minimum changes for the first `i` characters using `j` partitions. Transition involves considering all possible split points for the `j`-th partition.
4. Edge cases: String length 1 (no valid divisors for semi-palindrome check), `k` value constraints, empty string.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is roughly O(N^3 * M) due to DP states, substring operations, and the semi-palindrome check (where N is string length and M is substring length). Space complexity is O(N*K) for the DP table.
