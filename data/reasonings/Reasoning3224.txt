1. Problem summary: Minimize changes in an even-length array `nums` such that for all valid `i`, the absolute difference between `nums[i]` and `nums[n - 1 - i]` is a constant `X`, where elements can be changed to any integer from 0 to `k`.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Array manipulation, difference calculation, frequency counting, prefix sums.
3. Step-by-step approach: For each pair `(nums[i], nums[n-1-i])`, determine the possible values of `X`. The difference `diff = abs(nums[i] - nums[n-1-i])` can be achieved with 0 changes if `X = diff`. If `X` is different from `diff`, changes are needed. The number of changes required for a pair to satisfy `abs(a[i] - a[n - i - 1]) = X` is 0, 1, or 2. Analyze the cost for each possible `X` by considering the minimum changes needed for each pair. Utilize a difference array or frequency map to efficiently track costs for different `X` values and use prefix sums to find the minimum total changes.
4. Edge cases: The constraints on `n` (even, >= 2) and `k` (>= 0) are important. The case where `nums[i]` and `nums[n-1-i]` are equal. The range of values for `nums[i]` and `k`.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(n + k), space complexity is O(k).
