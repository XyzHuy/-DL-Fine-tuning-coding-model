1. Problem summary: Combine duplicate character counts and sort alphabetically to create a more efficient compressed string representation.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: String manipulation, Hash Map (Dictionary), Sorting.
3. Step-by-step approach: Iterate through the input compressed string, parsing character-frequency pairs. Use a dictionary (defaultdict) to aggregate the frequencies for each character. Finally, iterate through the sorted keys of the dictionary to construct the new compressed string.
4. Edge cases: Input string with only one character-frequency pair, input string with no duplicate characters, input string with frequencies greater than 9.
5. Time and space complexity: Time O(N + K log K), Space O(K), where N is the length of the compressed string and K is the number of unique characters.
