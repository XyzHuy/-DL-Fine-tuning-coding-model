1. Problem summary: Remove nodes from a linked list if there's any node with a greater value to their right.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Linked list manipulation, Stack-based approach.
3. Step-by-step approach: Traverse the list, using a stack to maintain candidates. If a current node is greater than the stack top, pop from stack. Push current node. Reconstruct list from stack.
4. Edge cases: Empty list, list with all same values, list with strictly increasing or decreasing values.
5. Time and space complexity: O(N) time complexity due to single pass and stack operations, O(N) space complexity for the stack.
