1. Problem summary: Find the minimum cost to travel from city 0 to city n-1 within a given maximum time, considering travel times between cities and passing fees for each city.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Graph traversal, Shortest Path algorithm (modified Dijkstra).
3. Step-by-step approach: Use a priority queue to explore paths, prioritizing lower cost and then shorter time. Maintain minimum time to reach each city to prune longer paths. Iterate until the destination is reached or the queue is empty.
4. Edge cases: The destination might be unreachable within maxTime. Multiple roads can connect the same two cities. The graph might have cycles.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(E log V) where E is the number of edges and V is the number of cities. Space complexity is O(V + E) for the graph and priority queue.
