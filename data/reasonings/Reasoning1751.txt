1. Problem summary: Maximize total value by attending at most k non-overlapping events from a given list of events, each with a start day, end day, and value.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Dynamic Programming, Greedy (with sorting), Binary Search.
3. Step-by-step approach: Sort events by start day. Use a 2D DP table where dp[i][j] is the max value attending at most j events considering events from index i onwards. For each event i and count j, decide whether to skip event i (dp[i+1][j]) or attend event i (event[i][2] + dp[next_non_overlapping_event][j-1]). The next non-overlapping event can be found efficiently using binary search.
4. Edge cases: k=1, no events, events with same start/end times, events that completely overlap, events that don't overlap.
5. Time and space complexity: Time: O(N^2 * K) without binary search for next event, O(N log N + N * K * log N) with binary search for finding next event, O(N log N + N * K) if binary search is optimized to O(log N) per lookup. Space: O(N * K) for the DP table.
