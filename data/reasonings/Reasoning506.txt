1. Problem summary: Given an array of athlete scores, determine the rank of each athlete and return an array of their ranks (Gold, Silver, Bronze, or numerical).
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Sorting and array manipulation.
3. Step-by-step approach: Sort the scores in descending order while maintaining the original index. Iterate through the sorted scores and assign ranks based on the index. Use "Gold Medal", "Silver Medal", "Bronze Medal" for the top 3 and string representation of the rank for the rest.
4. Edge cases: Empty input array, array with one element, handling of ranks beyond 3.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(n log n) due to sorting. Space complexity is O(n) to store the sorted scores and the result array.
