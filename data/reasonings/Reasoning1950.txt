1. Problem summary: For each possible subarray length k (from 1 to n), find the maximum of the minimums of all subarrays of length k.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Monotonic Stack, Array Manipulation, Range Queries (implicitly).
3. Step-by-step approach: Use two monotonic stacks to find the previous and next smaller elements for each number. This defines the largest subarray where the current number is the minimum. Then, use a frequency array to store the maximum value for each possible subarray length. Finally, iterate backwards through the frequency array to propagate maximums.
4. Edge cases: Array with a single element. All elements are the same. Strictly increasing or decreasing arrays.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(n) due to single passes for stacks and frequency array. Space complexity is O(n) for storing left, right arrays, stack, and frequency array.
