1. Problem summary: Reorder an array such that elements alternate between being less than or equal to and greater than or equal to their neighbors.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Array manipulation, sorting (implicitly).
3. Step-by-step approach: Iterate through the array, comparing adjacent elements. If the current comparison violates the wiggle condition (less than or greater than), swap the elements. Toggle the comparison expectation after each comparison.
4. Edge cases: Array of length 1, already wiggle-sorted array, duplicate numbers in the array. The prompt guarantees a valid answer, so no need to check for an empty array.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(n) because we iterate through the array once. Space complexity is O(1) because we perform in-place swaps.
