1. Problem summary: Given an m x n matrix initialized to zeros, increment all cells in a specified row and column for each entry in a list of indices, and return the total count of odd-valued cells.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Matrix manipulation, counting.
3. Step-by-step approach: Track the number of times each row and column is incremented using separate arrays. For each index [ri, ci], increment the count for row ri and column ci. Finally, iterate through each cell (ri, ci) in the matrix, sum the increments for its row and column, and if the sum is odd, increment a total odd count.
4. Edge cases: The matrix dimensions m and n can be small or up to 50. The number of indices can be up to 100. Indices are within bounds.
5. Time and space complexity: O(m*n + L) time for iterating through the matrix and processing indices, and O(m + n) space for storing row and column increments, where L is the length of indices.
