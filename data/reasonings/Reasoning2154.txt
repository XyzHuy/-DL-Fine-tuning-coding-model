1. Problem summary: Given a list of numbers and an initial value, repeatedly double the initial value if it exists in the list until it's no longer found, then return the final value.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Iterative search and update.
3. Step-by-step approach: Convert the input list to a set for efficient lookups. Continuously check if the current 'original' value is present in the set. If it is, double 'original' and repeat the check. If it's not found, stop and return the current 'original' value.
4. Edge cases: The initial 'original' value might not be present in the list at all. The list could be empty, though constraints say length is at least 1.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(N) for set creation, and in the worst case, O(log M) lookups where M is the final value. Space complexity is O(N) for storing the set.
