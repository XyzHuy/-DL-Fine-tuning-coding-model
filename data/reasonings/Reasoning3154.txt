1. Problem summary: Find the number of distinct ways to reach stair k starting from stair 1, with operations to go down 1 stair (cannot be consecutive or on stair 0) or up 2^jump stairs (incrementing jump for each use).
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Dynamic Programming with Memoization (DFS with caching).
3. Step-by-step approach: Use a recursive function (DFS) with memoization to explore possible paths. The state includes current stair (i), if the previous move was down (j, where 0 means up, 1 means down), and the current jump power. Base cases are reaching stair k (count as a way) or exceeding k+1 (invalid path). Explore moving down if allowed and moving up.
4. Edge cases: k = 0 is a special case. Initial stair is 1. The problem states infinite stairs.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(k) and space complexity is O(k) due to memoization state, where k is the target stair.
