1. Problem summary: Given books with thickness and height, and a shelf width, find the minimum height of the bookshelf when placing books in order onto shelves with the given width.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Dynamic Programming.
3. Step-by-step approach: Use dynamic programming to calculate the minimum height. Iterate through each book. The height up to book `i` is either the height up to `i-1` plus the height of the current book, or it's the minimum height up to book `j-1` plus the maximum height from books `j` to `i` if those books fit on the same shelf.
4. Edge cases: Empty book list, single book. Shelf width smaller than the thinnest book (not possible based on the constraints).
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(n^2), where n is the number of books. Space complexity is O(n).
