1. Problem summary: Given a road string with potholes ('x') and smooth parts ('.') and a budget, find the maximum number of potholes that can be fixed by repairing consecutive potholes with a cost of n+1 for n potholes, without exceeding the budget.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Greedy algorithm, dynamic programming (implicitly considered for initial thought but greedy is optimal here).
3. Step-by-step approach: Split the road into segments of consecutive potholes. For each segment, calculate the number of potholes and the cost to fix them. Sort these segments by their fixing cost. Iterate through the sorted segments, fixing as many whole segments as the budget allows. If a segment cannot be fully fixed, greedily fix individual potholes from that segment until the budget is exhausted or no more potholes can be fixed.
4. Edge cases: No potholes in the road string, budget being too small to fix even a single pothole, budget being large enough to fix all potholes.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is dominated by sorting the pothole segments, which is O(N log K), where N is the length of the road and K is the number of pothole segments. Space complexity is O(K) to store pothole segment information.
