1. Problem summary: Find the intersection of two lists of sorted, disjoint closed intervals.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Interval intersection, two pointers.
3. Step-by-step approach: Use two pointers to iterate through both lists simultaneously. Calculate the intersection of the intervals pointed to by the two pointers. Advance the pointer of the interval that ends earlier.
4. Edge cases: Empty input lists, no overlapping intervals.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(m+n), where m and n are the lengths of the two lists. Space complexity is O(min(m,n)) in the worst case, where almost every interval overlaps, but typically less.
