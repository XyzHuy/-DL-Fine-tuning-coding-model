1. Problem summary: Find the number of triplets in an array that can form valid triangles.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Sorting and Two Pointers
3. Step-by-step approach: Sort the input array. Iterate from the end of the array. Use two pointers, left and right, to find pairs that satisfy the triangle inequality.
4. Edge cases: Array with less than 3 elements. Zero or negative side lengths.
5. Time and space complexity: Time: O(n^2), Space: O(1)
