1. Problem summary: Given a matrix of 0s and 1s, find the distance to the nearest 0 for each cell.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Graph traversal / Breadth-First Search (BFS).
3. Step-by-step approach: Initialize a distance matrix with -1. Add all 0 cells to a queue and set their distance to 0. Perform BFS, updating the distance of neighboring cells until all cells have been visited.
4. Edge cases: Empty matrix, matrix with only 0s, matrix with only 1s (though the problem guarantees at least one 0). Handle boundary conditions when exploring neighbors.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(m*n) because each cell is visited at most once. Space complexity is O(m*n) for the distance matrix and the queue in the worst case.
