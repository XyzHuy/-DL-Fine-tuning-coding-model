1. Problem summary: Given a grid, starting position, and maximum moves, find the number of paths to move the ball out of bounds.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Dynamic Programming (DP)
3. Step-by-step approach: Use a 3D DP array to store the number of ways to reach each cell with a given number of moves. Iterate through the possible moves, and for each cell, check the adjacent cells. If an adjacent cell is out of bounds, increment the count. Otherwise, add the number of ways to reach the adjacent cell in the previous number of moves.
4. Edge cases: The ball starts out of bounds, maxMove is zero.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(maxMove * m * n), and space complexity is O(maxMove * m * n).
