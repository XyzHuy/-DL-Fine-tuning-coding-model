1. Problem summary: Find the employee ID who worked the longest task, breaking ties by choosing the smallest employee ID. Tasks are sequential and their durations are calculated based on consecutive log entries.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Iteration, tracking maximum value with tie-breaking.
3. Step-by-step approach: Initialize `max_time` and `result_id` with the first log's duration and employee ID. Iterate through the logs starting from the second entry. For each log, calculate the current task's duration by subtracting the previous log's leave time from the current log's leave time. If the current duration is greater than `max_time`, update `max_time` and `result_id`. If the current duration is equal to `max_time` and the current employee ID is smaller than `result_id`, update `result_id`.
4. Edge cases: The problem statement guarantees `logs.length >= 1` and `leaveTimei` are strictly increasing, simplifying initial setup and duration calculation. All employee IDs and times are within specified ranges. Tie-breaking for the smallest ID is handled by the conditional update.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(L) where L is the number of logs, as we iterate through the logs once. Space complexity is O(1) as we only use a few variables to store the maximum time and result ID.
