1. Problem summary: Decode a string encoded with the format k[encoded_string], repeating the encoded_string k times.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: String manipulation, stack.
3. Step-by-step approach: Use a stack to store the current string and repetition count when encountering an opening bracket. When encountering a closing bracket, pop the previous string and repetition count from the stack, and repeat the current string accordingly, appending to the previous string. Accumulate the current number and string as we iterate through the input.
4. Edge cases: Empty string, single character string, nested encoded strings, large repetition counts. The problem statement guarantees a valid input and the result length does not exceed 10^5.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(N*M) where N is the length of the string and M is the maximum repeat count. Space complexity is O(N), due to the stack and the intermediate strings.
