1. Problem summary: Count pairs of indices (i, j) with i < j such that hours[i] + hours[j] is a multiple of 24.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Hash Map (Dictionary) / Counting Pairs.
3. Step-by-step approach: Iterate through the hours array. For each hour, calculate its remainder when divided by 24. Determine the "complement" remainder that, when added to the current remainder, results in a multiple of 24. Add the count of this complement seen so far to the total pair count. Then, increment the count for the current remainder in the frequency map.
4. Edge cases: Empty input array (though constraints say length >= 1), single element array, all hours are multiples of 24, hours that sum up to exactly 24, 48, etc.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(N) due to a single pass through the array. Space complexity is O(1) because the remainder_count dictionary will have at most 24 keys (remainders 0-23).
