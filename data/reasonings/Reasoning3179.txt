1. Problem summary: Simulate an array update process k times, where each element becomes the sum of preceding elements plus itself, and return the last element modulo 10^9 + 7.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Simulation, Dynamic Programming (Implicit).
3. Step-by-step approach: Initialize an array of size n with all 1s. Iterate k times. In each iteration, update each element from the second element onwards by adding the previous element to its current value, taking the result modulo 10^9 + 7. Return the last element of the array.
4. Edge cases: n = 1 (array has only one element, which remains 1). k = 0 (no updates, array remains all 1s).
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(k * n) due to nested loops. Space complexity is O(n) to store the array.
