1. Problem summary: Given an array of integers and a value, find the maximum possible MEX (minimum excluded non-negative integer) of the array after applying any number of additions or subtractions of 'value' to its elements.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Greedy, Number Theory (Modular Arithmetic).
3. Step-by-step approach: For each potential MEX value (starting from 0), check if it can be formed by modifying an element in nums. An element `x` can form `i` if `x % value == i % value` and `x <= i`. Track the counts of remainders modulo `value`. Iterate through potential MEX values `i` from 0 upwards. If the remainder `i % value` is available in the counts, decrement its count; otherwise, `i` is the maximum achievable MEX.
4. Edge cases: If all numbers up to `len(nums)` can be formed, the MEX is `len(nums)`. Negative numbers in `nums` are handled correctly by the modulo operation.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(N) to compute remainders and their counts, and O(N) in the worst case to iterate through potential MEX values, where N is the length of nums. Space complexity is O(V) to store remainder counts, where V is the value, or O(N) if V > N.
