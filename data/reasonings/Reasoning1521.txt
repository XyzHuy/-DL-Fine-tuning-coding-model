1. Problem summary: Find the minimum absolute difference between the bitwise AND of any subarray of `arr` and the `target` value.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Subarray manipulation, bitwise operations, optimization.
3. Step-by-step approach: Iterate through the array with `r` as the right boundary of the subarray. Maintain a set `unique_vals` of all possible bitwise AND values for subarrays ending at the current `r`. For each `r`, update `unique_vals` by taking the bitwise AND of `arr[r]` with all existing values in `unique_vals` and also adding `arr[r]` itself. Calculate the minimum difference between each value in `unique_vals` and `target`, and update the overall minimum difference.
4. Edge cases: Empty array (not possible by constraints), array with a single element, target far from array elements. The set naturally handles duplicate AND values.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(N * log(max(arr_i))) due to set operations on up to ~30 values per iteration. Space complexity is O(log(max(arr_i))) because the size of the unique_vals set is bounded.
