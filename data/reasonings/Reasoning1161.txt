1. Problem summary: Find the level in a binary tree with the maximum sum of node values.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Binary Tree, Breadth-First Search (BFS).
3. Step-by-step approach: Use BFS to traverse the tree level by level. Calculate the sum of nodes at each level. Keep track of the maximum sum encountered so far and the corresponding level.
4. Edge cases: Empty tree (though the problem states the range is [1, 10^4] so this won't happen), tree with a single node, levels with negative sums.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(N), where N is the number of nodes in the tree. Space complexity is O(W), where W is the maximum width of the tree (maximum number of nodes at any level), in the worst case O(N).
