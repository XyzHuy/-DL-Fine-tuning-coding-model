1. Problem summary: Count the number of English letters that appear in both lowercase and uppercase forms within a given string.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: String manipulation, Set operations.
3. Step-by-step approach: Initialize two sets, one for lowercase characters and one for uppercase characters. Iterate through the input string, adding lowercase characters to the lowercase set and the lowercase version of uppercase characters to the uppercase set. Then, iterate through the lowercase set and check for the presence of each character in the uppercase set, incrementing a counter for each match.
4. Edge cases: The input string may contain only lowercase letters, only uppercase letters, or a mix. It could also contain no special characters at all. The constraints ensure the string is not empty.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(N) where N is the length of the string, due to iterating through the string once and then iterating through at most 26 elements (for the set check). Space complexity is O(1) as the sets will store at most 26 lowercase and 26 uppercase characters.
