1. Problem summary: Reformat a license key string by grouping characters into size k, except possibly the first group, separating groups with dashes, and converting to uppercase.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: String manipulation.
3. Step-by-step approach: Remove dashes and convert the string to uppercase. Calculate the length of the first group. Create the first group and then iterate through the rest of the string, adding dashes and groups of size k.
4. Edge cases: Empty string after removing dashes, k larger than the string length, first group being empty.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(n) where n is the length of the input string. Space complexity is O(n) for the resulting string.
