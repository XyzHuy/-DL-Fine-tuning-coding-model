1. Problem summary: The problem asks to count the number of indices where the elements in the original array `heights` differ from the elements in the sorted array.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Array manipulation, sorting.
3. Step-by-step approach: Create a sorted copy of the input array `heights`. Iterate through both the original and sorted arrays, comparing elements at each index. Increment a counter if the elements at the current index differ. Return the final count.
4. Edge cases: Empty input array, already sorted input array, reverse sorted input array, arrays with duplicate values.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(n log n) due to sorting. Space complexity is O(n) to store the sorted array.
