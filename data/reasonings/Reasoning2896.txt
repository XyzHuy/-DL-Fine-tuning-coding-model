1. Problem summary: Minimize cost to make s1 equal to s2 by flipping characters, using two operations: flip any two chars (cost x) or flip adjacent chars (cost 1).
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Dynamic Programming with Memoization (Top-Down), Optimization problem.
3. Step-by-step approach: Identify differing indices. If count is odd, return -1. Use recursion with memoization to explore three choices at each state (defined by start and end indices of differing elements): 1. Flip `i` and `j` (cost x), 2. Flip `i` and `i+1` (cost 1), 3. Flip `j-1` and `j` (cost 1).
4. Edge cases: The number of differing characters must be even for a solution to exist. An empty list of differing indices (strings are already equal) should result in a cost of 0.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(N^2) where N is the number of differing indices (at most original string length n), due to memoization states. Space complexity is O(N^2) for the memoization cache.
