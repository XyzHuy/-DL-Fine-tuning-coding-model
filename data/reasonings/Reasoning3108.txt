1. Problem summary: Find the minimum bitwise AND cost of a walk between two nodes in an undirected weighted graph for multiple queries.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Graph, Union-Find, Bitwise Operations.
3. Step-by-step approach: Use Union-Find to group connected components. For each edge, union the two nodes and update the aggregate bitwise AND cost for the component. For each query, check if the start and end nodes are in the same component. If so, the minimum cost is the pre-calculated bitwise AND of all edge weights within that component. Otherwise, no walk exists.
4. Edge cases: Start and end nodes being the same (cost is 0), nodes not being connected in the graph (return -1).
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(E * alpha(N) + Q * alpha(N)) where E is the number of edges, Q is the number of queries, and alpha is the inverse Ackermann function. Space complexity is O(N) for Union-Find data structures.
