1. Problem summary: The task is to compute the triangular sum of an array of digits. This is done by repeatedly taking adjacent elements, summing them, and applying modulo 10, until only one element remains.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Iterative process, array manipulation.
3. Step-by-step approach: Repeatedly apply a transformation: create a new array where each element is the sum of adjacent elements in the current array modulo 10. Continue this until the array has only one element, which is the result.
4. Edge cases: The input array can have a single element, in which case the process terminates immediately and that element is the triangular sum. The constraints ensure the array is never empty.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(n^2) due to nested iterations (outer loop reduces length, inner list comprehension traverses). Space complexity is O(n) for storing the new arrays at each step.
