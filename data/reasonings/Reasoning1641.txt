1. Problem summary: Count the number of vowel-only strings of length n that are lexicographically sorted.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Dynamic Programming.
3. Step-by-step approach: Use a DP table where dp[i][j] represents the number of sorted strings of length i ending with the j-th vowel. The base case is dp[1][j] = 1 for all vowels. For longer strings, dp[i][j] is the sum of dp[i-1][k] for all k <= j, because a string ending with the j-th vowel can be formed by appending the j-th vowel to any sorted string of length i-1 ending with a vowel less than or equal to the j-th vowel.
4. Edge cases: The minimum value for n is 1. For n=1, there are 5 such strings (each vowel individually).
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(n * k^2) where k is the number of vowels (5), due to nested loops and summation. Space complexity is O(n * k). This can be optimized to O(n*k) time and O(k) space.
