1. Problem summary: Convert a decimal integer string to its Hexspeak representation by first converting to uppercase hexadecimal, then replacing '0' with 'O' and '1' with 'I'. Return "ERROR" if the representation contains invalid characters.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: String manipulation, number conversion.
3. Step-by-step approach: Convert the input decimal string to an integer. Convert the integer to its uppercase hexadecimal string representation. Replace all '0's with 'O's and all '1's with 'I's. Check if all characters in the resulting string are valid Hexspeak characters (A-F, I, O). If valid, return the string; otherwise, return "ERROR".
4. Edge cases: The input number could be small (e.g., "3") which results in hexadecimal digits not allowed in Hexspeak. The constraint `num` represents an integer up to 10^12, implying hexadecimal strings can be moderately long.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is dominated by the conversion to hexadecimal and string replacements/validations, which is proportional to the length of the hexadecimal string, roughly O(log N) where N is the decimal number, or O(L) where L is the length of the input string. Space complexity is O(L) for storing the hexadecimal string.
