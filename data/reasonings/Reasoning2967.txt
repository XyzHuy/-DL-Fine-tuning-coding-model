1. Problem summary: The goal is to find the minimum cost to make all elements in an array equal to a single palindromic number, where the cost is the sum of absolute differences between original and target values.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Optimization, Number theory, Median property.
3. Step-by-step approach: Generate all palindromic numbers up to 10^9. Sort the input array and find its median. Consider palindromic numbers close to this median as potential target values. Calculate the total cost for each candidate palindromic number and return the minimum cost.
4. Edge cases: The array might contain only one element. The generated palindromic numbers might be fewer than expected, or the median might fall outside the range of generated palindromes. The constraints on nums[i] and the target palindromic number (less than 10^9).
5. Time and space complexity: Generating palindromes dominates the time complexity. Sorting the input array takes O(N log N). Finding candidates is efficient. The overall time complexity is driven by palindrome generation and the number of candidate checks. Space complexity is for storing palindromes and sorted nums.
