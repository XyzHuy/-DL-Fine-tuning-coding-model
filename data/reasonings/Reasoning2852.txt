1. Problem summary: Calculate the sum of remoteness for all cells in an n*n grid, where remoteness of a non-blocked cell (i, j) is the sum of values of all cells unreachable from (i, j). Blocked cells have a remoteness of 0.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Graph traversal (DFS), Dynamic Programming (implicit through memoization/modification of grid).
3. Step-by-step approach: For each non-blocked cell, initiate a Depth First Search (DFS) to find all reachable cells and their total value sum. The total sum of values in the grid is pre-calculated. For a given cell, its remoteness is the total grid value sum minus the sum of values reachable from it, multiplied by the count of cells reachable from it. Sum these remoteness values for all cells.
4. Edge cases: A grid with only blocked cells, a grid with a single cell, a grid where all cells are reachable from each other.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(N^2) because each cell is visited and processed at most once during the DFS. Space complexity is O(N^2) for the recursion stack in the worst case.
