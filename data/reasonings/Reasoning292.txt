1. Problem summary: Determine if the first player can win the Nim game, where players take turns removing 1-3 stones and the last player to take a stone wins.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Game theory, mathematical pattern recognition.
3. Step-by-step approach: The key insight is that if n is a multiple of 4, the second player can always win. Otherwise, the first player can always win by taking n % 4 stones on their first turn.
4. Edge cases: The constraint 1 <= n <= 2^31 - 1 means we do not need to check invalid inputs.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(1), space complexity is O(1).
