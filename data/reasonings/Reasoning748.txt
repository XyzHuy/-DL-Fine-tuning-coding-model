1. Problem summary: Find the shortest word in a list of words that contains all the letters from a given license plate (case-insensitive), with at least the same frequency.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: String manipulation, counting, and comparison.
3. Step-by-step approach: Create a character frequency map of the license plate. Iterate through each word in the input list. For each word, create its frequency map and check if it contains all the characters from the license plate with sufficient frequency. Keep track of the shortest valid word found so far.
4. Edge cases: Empty license plate (though the problem guarantees an answer exists). Multiple words with the same shortest length, in which case the first occurring word is returned.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(N * M), where N is the number of words and M is the maximum length of a word, due to iterating through the words and checking the frequencies. Space complexity is O(1), as the character counts are limited by the size of the alphabet.
