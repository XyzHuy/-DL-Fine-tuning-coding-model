1. Problem summary: Determine if a given number is a confusing number, meaning its 180-degree rotation results in a different valid number.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: String manipulation, number conversion.
3. Step-by-step approach: Convert the integer to a string, iterate through the string, rotate each digit based on a given mapping (0->0, 1->1, 6->9, 8->8, 9->6). If an invalid digit is encountered (2, 3, 4, 5, 7), return False. Reverse the rotated digits to form the rotated number as a string, convert it to an integer to remove leading zeros, and compare it with the original number.
4. Edge cases: Numbers containing invalid digits (2, 3, 4, 5, 7), numbers that remain the same after rotation (e.g., 0, 1, 8, 11, 69, 96, 88), leading zeros after rotation.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(log n), where n is the input number (due to string conversion and iteration). Space complexity is O(log n) to store the rotated string.
