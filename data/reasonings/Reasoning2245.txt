1. Problem summary: Find the maximum number of trailing zeros in the product of a "cornered path" within a grid of positive integers. A cornered path has at most one turn and does not revisit cells.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Dynamic Programming (Prefix Sums), Grid Traversal.
3. Step-by-step approach: Precompute prefix sums of factors 2 and 5 for horizontal and vertical traversals. Iterate through each cell as a potential turn point, calculating the total factors of 2 and 5 for each of the four possible cornered path types originating from that cell. The minimum of these two factors (2s and 5s) for a path determines its trailing zeros. Maximize this over all cells and path types.
4. Edge cases: Grids with no factors of 2 or 5 (resulting in 0 trailing zeros). Paths that are purely horizontal or purely vertical (handled by prefix sums). Single cell grid.
5. Time and space complexity: Time O(m*n) for prefix sum calculation and O(m*n) for checking all corner paths, resulting in O(m*n). Space O(m*n) for storing prefix sums.
