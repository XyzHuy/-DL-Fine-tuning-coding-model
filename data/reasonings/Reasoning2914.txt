1. Problem summary: Minimize changes in a binary string of even length to make it partitionable into beautiful substrings (even length, all 0s or all 1s).
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Greedy approach, string manipulation.
3. Step-by-step approach: Iterate through the string in pairs of characters. For each pair, if the characters are different, increment a counter representing the number of changes needed. This is because each pair must become a homogeneous substring of length 2.
4. Edge cases: The problem constraints guarantee an even length string with length at least 2, so no empty string or odd length string is possible. The string can already be beautiful.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(n) where n is the length of the string, as we iterate through it once. Space complexity is O(1) as we only use a few variables.
