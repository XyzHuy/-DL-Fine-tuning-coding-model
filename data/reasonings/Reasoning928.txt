1. Problem summary: Given a graph and a set of initially infected nodes, determine which node to remove from the initial set to minimize the spread of malware.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Graph traversal (BFS), optimization.
3. Step-by-step approach: For each node in the initial set, temporarily remove it and perform a BFS from the remaining infected nodes. Count the number of infected nodes after the spread stops. Choose the node whose removal results in the smallest number of infected nodes.
4. Edge cases: Multiple nodes could result in the same minimum infection. In such a case, choose the node with the smallest index.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(n * |initial| * n), where n is the number of nodes and |initial| is the number of initially infected nodes. Space complexity is O(n).
