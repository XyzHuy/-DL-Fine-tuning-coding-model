1. Problem summary: Determine the minimum amount of money needed to guarantee a win in a guessing game where you have to pay the value of your incorrect guess, given a range from 1 to n.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Dynamic programming, specifically using a bottom-up approach to solve a minimax problem.
3. Step-by-step approach: Build a DP table where dp[i][j] stores the minimum cost to win the game in the range [i, j]. Iterate through different lengths of ranges and possible guesses within each range. The cost for a guess 'k' is k + max(cost to win in range [i, k-1], cost to win in range [k+1, j]). Minimize this cost for each range.
4. Edge cases: When i > k-1 or k < j, the cost to win in those ranges is 0. This handles cases where the guess is at the edge of the current range.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(n^3) due to the three nested loops (length, start, possible guesses). Space complexity is O(n^2) because of the 2D DP table.
