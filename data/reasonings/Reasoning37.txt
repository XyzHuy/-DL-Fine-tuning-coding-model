1. Problem summary: Fill a 9x9 Sudoku board such that each row, column, and 3x3 subgrid contains the digits 1-9 without repetition.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Backtracking search.
3. Step-by-step approach: Use backtracking to explore possible solutions. Maintain boolean arrays to track used digits in rows, columns, and 3x3 blocks. Recursively try placing digits in empty cells, and backtrack if a conflict occurs.
4. Edge cases: The problem statement guarantees a unique solution exists. The input board is always a 9x9 grid.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is difficult to precisely determine due to backtracking, but it's roughly O(9^(number of empty cells)). Space complexity is O(1) since the auxiliary space used by the boolean arrays is constant.
