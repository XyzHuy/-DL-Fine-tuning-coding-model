1. Problem summary: Calculate the count of users for each distinct number of unique active minutes (UAM) they have.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Hashing/Frequency Counting, Data Structures (Sets, Dictionaries).
3. Step-by-step approach: Group actions by user ID, store unique active minutes for each user in a set, then count the occurrences of each unique minute count across all users.
4. Edge cases: Users with no actions (not possible due to log constraints), logs with a single entry, all actions by the same user, all actions at the same minute.
5. Time and space complexity: O(N) time and O(N) space, where N is the number of log entries.
