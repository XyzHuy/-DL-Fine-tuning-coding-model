1. Problem summary: Find the number of permutations of an array of distinct positive integers such that adjacent elements are divisible by each other, modulo 10^9 + 7.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Dynamic Programming with Bitmasking.
3. Step-by-step approach: Use a recursive function with memoization (DP). The state should include a bitmask representing used elements and the index of the last element added. The base case is when all elements are used. Recursively explore valid next elements and sum up results.
4. Edge cases: The problem constraints state n >= 2, so an empty or single-element array is not a concern. The distinct positive integers constraint simplifies divisibility checks.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(n^2 * 2^n) due to n states for the last element and 2^n states for the bitmask, with each state taking O(n) to transition. Space complexity is O(n * 2^n) for the memoization table.
