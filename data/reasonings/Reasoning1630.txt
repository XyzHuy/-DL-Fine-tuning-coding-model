1. Problem summary: Given an array of numbers and multiple range queries, determine if the subarray defined by each query can be rearranged to form an arithmetic sequence.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Array manipulation, arithmetic sequences, range queries.
3. Step-by-step approach: For each query (l, r), extract the subarray, find its minimum and maximum elements, and calculate the potential common difference. Check if all expected arithmetic sequence elements (from min to max with the calculated difference) exist within the subarray.
4. Edge cases: Subarrays with only two elements are always arithmetic. The common difference can be zero. All elements within a subarray might be identical.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(m * n log n) if sorting is used within each check, or O(m * n) if using sets for checking element existence. Space complexity is O(n) to store the set of subarray elements for each query.
