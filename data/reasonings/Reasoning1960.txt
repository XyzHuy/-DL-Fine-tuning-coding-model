1. Problem summary: Find two non-intersecting palindromic substrings of odd length with the maximum product of their lengths.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: String manipulation, Dynamic Programming, Manacher's Algorithm.
3. Step-by-step approach: Precompute the maximum odd length palindrome ending at each index from the left and starting at each index from the right using Manacher's algorithm. Iterate through all possible split points and calculate the product of the maximum left palindrome and the maximum right palindrome.
4. Edge cases: Strings with minimum length (2), where no two non-intersecting odd-length palindromes might exist or their product could be small.
5. Time and space complexity: O(N) time for Manacher's algorithm and O(N) space to store precomputed palindrome lengths.
