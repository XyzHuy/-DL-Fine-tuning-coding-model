1. Problem summary: Given a string `s` and a keypad mapping rule (each button maps to 1-3 unique letters, all 26 letters mapped), find the minimum keypresses to type `s`.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Greedy algorithm, Frequency analysis, Optimization.
3. Step-by-step approach: Count character frequencies in `s`. Sort characters by frequency descending. Assign the most frequent characters to require 1 press (first 9 most frequent), next most frequent to 2 presses (next 9), and least frequent to 3 presses (remaining 8). Sum up the total presses.
4. Edge cases: The problem constraints imply `s` is non-empty and contains only lowercase English letters. The keypad mapping is always possible and covers all letters.
5. Time and space complexity: Time O(N log N) due to sorting frequencies, Space O(K) where K is the number of unique characters (at most 26).
