1. Problem summary: The problem asks for the minimum number of rectangles to cover a set of 2D points, where each rectangle has a fixed width `w` and can extend vertically to cover any `y` range. The constraint is that the rectangle's horizontal span `x2 - x1` must be at most `w`.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Greedy algorithm. The key observation is that we only need to consider the x-coordinates for determining coverage due to the rectangles' infinite vertical extent.
3. Step-by-step approach: First, sort the points based on their x-coordinates. Iterate through the sorted points, starting a new rectangle from the leftmost uncovered point. This rectangle will extend horizontally `w` units to the right from the current point's x-coordinate. Then, advance the pointer to the first point whose x-coordinate is outside the current rectangle's horizontal span. Repeat this process until all points are covered, incrementing the rectangle count each time a new rectangle is started.
4. Edge cases: An empty list of points would require 0 rectangles. A single point requires 1 rectangle. If `w` is 0, each point might require its own rectangle if their x-coordinates differ.
5. Time and space complexity: Sorting the points takes O(N log N) time, where N is the number of points. The greedy traversal takes O(N) time. Thus, the overall time complexity is O(N log N). The space complexity is O(1) if sorting is done in-place, or O(N) if a copy is made for sorting.
