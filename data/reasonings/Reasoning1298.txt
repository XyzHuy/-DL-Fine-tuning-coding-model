1. Problem summary: Collect maximum candies from boxes, starting with initial boxes, by opening them if they are status 1 or if a key is found. Keys and contained boxes are revealed upon opening a box.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Graph traversal (BFS or DFS variation) / Simulation.
3. Step-by-step approach: Maintain sets of boxes owned and keys possessed. Iteratively find an owned box that is open or for which a key is possessed. If found, collect its candies, add its keys to owned keys, and add its contained boxes to owned boxes. Repeat until no more boxes can be opened.
4. Edge cases: No initial boxes, all boxes are closed, no keys available, boxes containing other boxes that cannot be opened.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(N), where N is the number of boxes, as each box is processed at most once. Space complexity is O(N) to store sets of boxes, keys, and visited status.
