1. Problem summary: Given an array that was an arithmetic progression with one interior element removed, find the removed element.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Arithmetic progression, Summation properties.
3. Step-by-step approach: Determine the total number of elements in the original progression, calculate the expected sum of the full progression using its first and last elements and total count, calculate the actual sum of the given array, and the difference is the missing number.
4. Edge cases: The problem statement guarantees the input array is valid and the removed element is not the first or last, so no specific edge case handling is needed beyond the standard calculation.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(N) due to summing the array, and space complexity is O(1) as only a few variables are used.
