1. Problem summary: Two robots move from (0,0) to (1, n-1) on a 2xN grid. The first robot moves first, clearing its path. The second robot moves second. The first robot wants to minimize the second robot's score, while the second robot wants to maximize its score. We need to find the second robot's score assuming optimal play.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Game Theory / Prefix Sums. The problem involves optimal strategies for two players, and prefix sums are used to efficiently calculate path sums.
3. Step-by-step approach: Calculate prefix sums for the top row and suffix sums for the bottom row. Iterate through each column `i` representing a potential turning point. For each `i`, the first robot can choose to clear the top row up to `i` or the bottom row from `i`. The second robot will then collect the remaining points from the other row segment. The first robot aims to minimize the maximum points the second robot can collect by picking the best `i`.
4. Edge cases: The grid size can be small (n=1). The turning point `i` can be at the very beginning or end of the grid, affecting which row segments are relevant.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(N) due to prefix and suffix sum calculations and the single pass to find the minimum maximum. Space complexity is O(N) for storing prefix and suffix sums.
