1. Problem summary: Find the largest distance between two adjacent 1's in the binary representation of a given integer.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: String manipulation / Binary representation / Iteration
3. Step-by-step approach: Convert the integer to its binary string, iterate through the string, keep track of the last seen '1' and calculate the distance to the current '1', updating the maximum distance if necessary.
4. Edge cases: No adjacent 1's (return 0), input n is 1 (binary is "1", return 0), input with leading or trailing zeros.
5. Time and space complexity: Time: O(log n) due to iterating through the binary representation. Space: O(log n) for storing the binary string.
