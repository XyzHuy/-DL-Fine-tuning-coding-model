1. Problem summary: Find the first string in a given list that reads the same forwards and backwards.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: String manipulation, Linear search.
3. Step-by-step approach: Iterate through each word in the input list. For each word, check if it is a palindrome by comparing it to its reversed version. If a palindrome is found, return it immediately. If the loop finishes without finding any palindromes, return an empty string.
4. Edge cases: An empty input list (though constraints state 1 <= words.length), a list with no palindromic strings, a list where the first element is a palindrome.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(N*L), where N is the number of words and L is the maximum length of a word, due to iterating through words and reversing each. Space complexity is O(1) if string slicing doesn't create new strings, or O(L) if it does, for storing reversed strings.
