1. Problem summary: Count the number of indices in an array whose removal results in an array where the sum of elements at odd indices equals the sum of elements at even indices.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Prefix Sums.
3. Step-by-step approach: Calculate prefix sums for both even and odd indexed elements separately. Then, for each index, simulate its removal by adjusting the sums of the remaining elements to the left and right of the removed index, and check if the sums are equal.
4. Edge cases: Arrays with a single element (always fair after removal as the array becomes empty).
5. Time and space complexity: O(N) time complexity due to two passes for prefix sums and one pass for checking removals, and O(N) space complexity for storing prefix sums.
