1. Problem summary: Convert a Binary Search Tree to a Greater Sum Tree, where each node's value is replaced by the sum of all nodes greater than or equal to it.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Tree Traversal, Binary Search Tree.
3. Step-by-step approach: Perform a reverse inorder traversal of the BST. During the traversal, maintain a running sum of the nodes visited so far. Update the current node's value to be the running sum.
4. Edge cases: Empty tree (root is None).
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(N) where N is the number of nodes in the tree. Space complexity is O(H) in the average case, where H is the height of the tree (call stack for recursion), and O(N) in the worst case (skewed tree).
