1. Problem summary: Find the length of the longest palindrome that can be constructed from the given string `s`, considering case sensitivity.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: String manipulation, hashmap (Counter), greedy algorithm.
3. Step-by-step approach: Count character frequencies. Add even counts directly to the length. For odd counts, add count-1 and use at most one odd count character as the center of the palindrome.
4. Edge cases: Empty string (should return 0, but the constraint says the string length is at least 1), string with only one character.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(n) due to iterating through the string and the counter. Space complexity is O(1) because the size of the counter is limited by the number of possible characters (lowercase and uppercase English letters which is a constant).
