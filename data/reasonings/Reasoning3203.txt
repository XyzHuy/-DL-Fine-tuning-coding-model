1. Problem summary: Given two trees, find the minimum diameter of the combined tree after connecting one node from each tree.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Tree diameter calculation, graph algorithms.
3. Step-by-step approach: Calculate the diameter of each individual tree. The resulting tree's diameter will be the maximum of the individual diameters, or the sum of half the diameters plus one when connected. The minimum of these options is the answer.
4. Edge cases: Trees with a single node (diameter 0), small trees.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(N + M) where N and M are the number of nodes in each tree, due to two DFS traversals for each tree diameter. Space complexity is O(N + M) for adjacency list representation.
