1. Problem summary: Given an integer, perform two digit replacement operations to maximize the difference between the resulting numbers, ensuring no leading zeros or zero values.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Brute force (implicit via iterating through replacements) and string manipulation.
3. Step-by-step approach: To maximize the difference, we aim to create the largest possible number and the smallest possible number. The largest number is achieved by replacing a digit with '9'. The smallest is achieved by replacing a digit with '0' (or '1' if the first digit is '0').
4. Edge cases: The input number can be a single digit. The first digit cannot be replaced by '0' if it's the leading digit. If all digits are '9' for max, or '1' for min, no replacement occurs.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(L) where L is the number of digits in num, as we iterate through the digits a constant number of times. Space complexity is O(L) to store the string representation of the number.
