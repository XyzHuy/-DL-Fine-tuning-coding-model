1. Problem summary: Rearrange characters of given words into vertical columns, padding with spaces if necessary, and remove trailing spaces.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: String manipulation, matrix traversal simulation.
3. Step-by-step approach: Split the input string into words. Determine the maximum length among all words. Create a list of strings to store the vertical words, initialized to empty strings. Iterate through each column index up to the maximum length. For each column, iterate through all words. If a word has a character at the current column index, append it to the corresponding vertical word; otherwise, append a space. Finally, remove any trailing spaces from each generated vertical word.
4. Edge cases: Input string with a single word, input string with words of varying lengths, input string with short words after long words.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(N*M) where N is the number of words and M is the length of the longest word. Space complexity is O(N*M) to store the result.
