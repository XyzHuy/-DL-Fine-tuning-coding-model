1. Problem summary: Given an array of fruit prices, where purchasing fruit i grants free access to the next i fruits, find the minimum cost to acquire all fruits.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Dynamic Programming.
3. Step-by-step approach: Use dynamic programming. dp[i] stores the minimum cost to buy the first i fruits. To calculate dp[i], consider buying fruit i directly (dp[i-1] + prices[i-1]) or using a free offer from a previous purchase j (dp[j-1] + prices[j-1]), if fruit i is within the free range of fruit j.
4. Edge cases: An empty prices array is not possible due to constraints. The base case dp[0] = 0 is crucial.
5. Time and space complexity: O(n^2) time due to nested loops, and O(n) space for the DP table.
