1. Problem summary: Determine if three given side lengths can form a triangle and classify it as equilateral, isosceles, or scalene.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Geometry, Conditional Logic.
3. Step-by-step approach: First, sort the side lengths. Then, check the triangle inequality theorem (sum of two sides > third side). If it fails, return "none". Otherwise, check for equilateral (all sides equal), then isosceles (two sides equal), and finally scalene (all sides different).
4. Edge cases: The primary edge case is when the triangle inequality theorem is not satisfied, meaning no triangle can be formed.
5. Time and space complexity: O(1) time for sorting a fixed-size array and constant time for comparisons, O(1) space as the input array size is fixed.
