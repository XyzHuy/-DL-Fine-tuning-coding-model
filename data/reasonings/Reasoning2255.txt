1. Problem summary: Count how many strings in a given list `words` are prefixes of another string `s`.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: String manipulation, iteration.
3. Step-by-step approach: Initialize a counter to zero. Iterate through each `word` in the `words` list. For each `word`, check if `s` starts with `word`. If it does, increment the counter. Finally, return the counter.
4. Edge cases: Empty `words` list, `words` containing empty strings, `s` being an empty string, `words` containing strings longer than `s`.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(N * M) where N is the number of words and M is the length of s, due to `startswith`. Space complexity is O(1) as only a counter is used.
