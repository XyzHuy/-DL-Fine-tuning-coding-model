1. Problem summary: Find the minimum distance between two given words in a list of words.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Array traversal.
3. Step-by-step approach: Iterate through the wordsDict, keeping track of the most recent indices of word1 and word2. Update the minimum distance whenever both indices are valid.
4. Edge cases: The wordsDict contains at least two words, and word1 and word2 exist and are distinct. Also, initialize indices to -1 and distance to infinity.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(n), where n is the length of wordsDict. Space complexity is O(1).
