1. Problem summary: Find the next lexicographically greater permutation of a given array of integers, modifying the array in-place. If no greater permutation exists, rearrange to the smallest permutation (ascending order).
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Array manipulation, permutation generation, sorting.
3. Step-by-step approach: Find the first decreasing element from the right. If not found, reverse the entire array. Otherwise, find the smallest element to the right of the decreasing element that's greater than it, swap them, and reverse the portion of the array to the right of the original decreasing element.
4. Edge cases: Empty array, single element array, already sorted in descending order (largest permutation).
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(n) because we iterate through the array at most three times. Space complexity is O(1) since the modifications are done in-place.
