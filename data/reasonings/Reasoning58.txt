1. Problem summary: Find the length of the last word in a given string containing words and spaces.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: String manipulation.
3. Step-by-step approach: First, remove leading/trailing spaces. Then, split the string into a list of words based on spaces. Finally, return the length of the last word in the list.
4. Edge cases: Empty string after stripping, multiple spaces between words.
5. Time and space complexity: Time: O(n), Space: O(n), where n is the length of the input string.
