1. Problem summary: Count the number of arrays of length n where each element is between 1 and maxValue, and each element is divisible by the previous one.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Dynamic programming, Combinatorics, Number theory (prime factorization).
3. Step-by-step approach: For each number x from 1 to maxValue, find its prime factorization. For each prime factor p with exponent e, we need to choose n positions for this factor across the array. This is equivalent to a stars and bars problem where we are distributing n "slots" among e+1 bins (before the first occurrence, between occurrences, after the last occurrence), which can be calculated using combinations C(n+e-1, e). Sum up the counts for all prime factors of x. Finally, sum these counts for all x from 1 to maxValue.
4. Edge cases: n=2 (minimum length), maxValue=1 (only possible array is [1,1,...,1]), large n and maxValue.
5. Time and space complexity: The time complexity is dominated by iterating through maxValue and performing prime factorization for each number up to maxValue, and calculating combinations. Prime factorization takes roughly O(sqrt(maxValue)). Calculating combinations with precomputed factorials can be O(1) or O(n) depending on implementation. Thus, roughly O(maxValue * (sqrt(maxValue) + n)). Space complexity is O(log(maxValue)) for storing prime factors.
