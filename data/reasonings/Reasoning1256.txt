1. Problem summary: Convert a non-negative integer `num` into a specific encoded string based on a deduced secret function.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Bit manipulation, String conversion.
3. Step-by-step approach: Add 1 to the input number, convert the result to its binary string representation, and then remove the leading '1' from this binary string.
4. Edge cases: The input `num` can be 0.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(log N) due to binary conversion, and space complexity is O(log N) to store the binary string.
