1. Problem summary: Given two integer arrays nums1 and nums2 of the same length, find the minimum number of swaps required to make both arrays strictly increasing.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Dynamic programming.
3. Step-by-step approach: Use dynamic programming. Keep track of the minimum swaps needed at each index, considering whether or not to swap the elements at that index. Use two arrays, keep and swap, to store the minimum swaps needed up to the current index without swapping and with swapping, respectively. Iterate through the arrays, updating keep[i] and swap[i] based on whether the previous elements satisfy the increasing condition and whether swapping the current elements helps.
4. Edge cases: The problem statement guarantees that a solution is always possible. Consider the base case where i=0 to initiate the dynamic programming approach.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(n) due to the single loop through the arrays. Space complexity is O(n) because of the two arrays, keep and swap, of size n.
