1. Problem summary: Determine if the first player can win a number-choosing game where players alternate adding numbers from 1 to maxChoosableInteger to a running total until it reaches or exceeds desiredTotal, without reusing numbers.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Game theory, recursion with memoization (dynamic programming), bit manipulation.
3. Step-by-step approach: Use recursion with memoization to explore all possible game states. A bitmask represents the numbers already chosen. The function checks if the current player can win by choosing a number that reaches the desired total or forces the opponent to lose recursively. Base cases include when the desired total is already reached or the sum of all available numbers is less than the desired total.
4. Edge cases: If desiredTotal <= 0, the first player wins immediately. If the sum of all numbers from 1 to maxChoosableInteger is less than desiredTotal, no one can win, so the first player loses.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(2^n), where n is maxChoosableInteger, due to the memoization significantly pruning the search space. Space complexity is O(2^n) due to the memoization cache storing results for each possible state.
