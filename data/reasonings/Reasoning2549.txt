1. Problem summary: Given an initial number n, repeatedly add numbers x such that x % i == 1 for existing numbers x and valid i. Count distinct numbers after a very long time.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Number theory, observation.
3. Step-by-step approach: For any number k > 1, if k is on the board, we can generate k-1 because k % (k-1) == 1. This implies that if n is present, n-1 can be generated. If n-1 is present, n-2 can be generated, and so on, until 2 is generated from 3 (3 % 2 == 1). Since n is initially present, all numbers from 2 to n can eventually be generated. The number 1 is never generated as x % i == 1 requires x > 1. The count is thus all numbers from 2 to n plus the initial n, which is n-1 numbers if n > 1.
4. Edge cases: When n = 1, only 1 is present. No new numbers can be generated since x % i == 1 requires x > 1.
5. Time and space complexity: O(1) time, O(1) space.
