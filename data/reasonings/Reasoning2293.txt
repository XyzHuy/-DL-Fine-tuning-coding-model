1. Problem summary: Repeatedly apply a min/max operation on pairs of adjacent elements in an array until only one element remains, returning that final element.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Simulation, Iterative Reduction.
3. Step-by-step approach: Start with the given array. While the array length is greater than 1, create a new array half its size. For even indices in the new array, take the minimum of the corresponding two elements in the old array. For odd indices, take the maximum. Replace the old array with the new one. Repeat until the array has only one element.
4. Edge cases: The input array has a length of 1 initially, in which case the single element is returned directly.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(n) where n is the initial length of nums, as each pass halves the array size. Space complexity is O(n) due to the creation of new arrays in each iteration.
