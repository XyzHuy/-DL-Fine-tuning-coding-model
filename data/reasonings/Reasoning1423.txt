1. Problem summary: Given an array of card points and an integer k, find the maximum score by taking exactly k cards, where each card can be taken from either the beginning or the end of the row.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Sliding Window.
3. Step-by-step approach: Calculate the sum of the first k cards as an initial score. Then, iterate k times. In each iteration, simulate taking a card from the end and a card from the beginning by updating the current sum. This is achieved by adding the next card from the end of the array and subtracting the card that is no longer part of the 'k' cards considered from the left. Keep track of the maximum sum encountered.
4. Edge cases: k equals the length of cardPoints (take all cards). k equals 1 (take the maximum of the first or last card).
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(k) because we iterate k times. Space complexity is O(1) as we only use a few variables to store sums and maximum score.
