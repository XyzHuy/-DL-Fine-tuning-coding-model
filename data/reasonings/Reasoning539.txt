1. Problem summary: Find the smallest difference in minutes between any two time points in a given list of times in "HH:MM" format.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Sorting, array manipulation, and finding the minimum difference.
3. Step-by-step approach: Convert all time strings to minutes from midnight, sort the resulting array, calculate the differences between consecutive times, and consider the difference between the first and last time points (taking into account the circular nature of time).
4. Edge cases: The minimum difference can occur between the first and last time points after sorting.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is dominated by sorting, which is O(n log n), where n is the number of time points. Space complexity is O(n) to store the minutes.
