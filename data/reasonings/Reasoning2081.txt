1. Problem summary: Find the sum of the first n smallest positive integers that are palindromic in both base-10 and base-k.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Number theory, Palindrome checking, Base conversion, Iterative generation.
3. Step-by-step approach: Iterate through possible number lengths, generate base-10 palindromes of that length, convert each to base-k, check if the base-k representation is also a palindrome, collect n such numbers, and sum them.
4. Edge cases: Single-digit numbers which are always palindromic in base-10 and potentially in base-k.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is difficult to precisely determine due to the nature of palindrome generation and base conversion, but it's roughly proportional to the magnitude of the nth k-mirror number and the base-k conversion cost. Space complexity is O(n) to store the found k-mirror numbers.
