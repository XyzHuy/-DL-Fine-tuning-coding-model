1. Problem summary: Track the count of the most frequent ID after each update operation (addition or removal) on a collection of IDs.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Data structures, Hash Map, Balanced Binary Search Tree (or similar ordered collection).
3. Step-by-step approach: Maintain a hash map to store current frequencies of each ID and a sorted list to store these frequencies. For each update, find the old frequency of the affected ID in the sorted list, remove it, update the ID's frequency in the hash map, and insert the new frequency into the sorted list. The maximum frequency is then the last element of the sorted list.
4. Edge cases: The collection can become empty at any step, in which case the most frequent count is 0. Frequencies of IDs are guaranteed to be non-negative.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(N log N) due to SortedList operations (insertion/removal), and space complexity is O(N) for the hash map and SortedList, where N is the length of nums and freq.
