1. Problem summary: Given an integer n, the problem asks to find the count of numbers between 1 and n (inclusive) that have at least one repeated digit.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Dynamic Programming / Combinatorics. The problem can be solved by counting the numbers with unique digits and subtracting it from the total numbers.
3. Step-by-step approach: Convert the integer n to a string. Calculate the number of integers with unique digits less than the length of the string. Then, iterate through the digits of the string, and for each digit, compute the number of valid numbers with unique digits possible with the same length. If no repeated digits are encountered until the end, increment the count by 1 (to include the number itself). Finally, subtract the count of unique digit numbers from n to get the result.
4. Edge cases: n = 1, n = 10, n = 100, numbers with all unique digits. The permutation function needs to handle the case when n = 0.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(log n) due to the string conversion and iteration over digits, where n is the input number. Space complexity is O(log n) due to the string representation of n and the seen set.
