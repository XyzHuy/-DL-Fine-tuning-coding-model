1. Problem summary: Identify nodes in a binary tree that are the sole child of their parent.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Tree Traversal (Depth-First Search).
3. Step-by-step approach: Traverse the tree using DFS. For each node, check if it has exactly one child. If so, add the child's value to the result list. Recurse on both children.
4. Edge cases: An empty tree (root is None) will return an empty list. A tree with only a root node will have no lonely nodes.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(N) as each node is visited once. Space complexity is O(H) for the recursion stack, where H is the height of the tree.
