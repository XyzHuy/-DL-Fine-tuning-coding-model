1. Problem summary: Find the maximum sum of a linear subsequence from a given stock prices array, where a linear subsequence satisfies the condition prices[indexes[j]] - prices[indexes[j - 1]] == indexes[j] - indexes[j - 1].
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Dynamic Programming / Greedy (rephrased as a grouping problem).
3. Step-by-step approach: Rearrange the linearity condition to prices[i] - i = prices[indexes[j-1]] - indexes[j-1]. This implies that all elements in a linear subsequence must share the same value of prices[i] - i. Iterate through the prices, calculate prices[i] - i for each index i, and group the prices by this calculated value. The maximum score will be the maximum sum of prices within any of these groups.
4. Edge cases: An empty input array (though constraints say length >= 1), or an array where no two elements can form a linear subsequence. The solution correctly handles these as the default value for a group sum is 0 and `max()` on an empty or single-element group will work.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(n) because we iterate through the prices array once. Space complexity is O(n) in the worst case, as the `group_sums` dictionary could store up to n distinct keys if all `price - i` values are unique.
