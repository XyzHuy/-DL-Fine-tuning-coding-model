1. Problem summary: Count pairs of food items whose deliciousness sums to a power of two, modulo 10^9 + 7.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Two pointers or Hash Map/Counter with optimization.
3. Step-by-step approach: Iterate through each food item. For each item, check potential complementary food values that would sum to a power of two (up to twice the maximum deliciousness). Use a counter to store frequencies of previously seen food items and add the count of complements to the total. Increment the counter for the current food item.
4. Edge cases: Empty input array, all elements are the same, duplicate deliciousness values, large deliciousness values requiring careful power-of-two calculation.
5. Time and space complexity: O(N * log(max_deliciousness)) time, O(N) space.
