1. Problem summary: Given an integer, find the maximum and minimum possible values by remapping exactly one digit to another, and return their difference.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: String manipulation, brute force (implicit).
3. Step-by-step approach: Convert the number to a string. To find the maximum, iterate through digits, find the first non-'9' digit, and replace all occurrences with '9'. To find the minimum, replace the first digit with '0'. Convert the modified strings back to integers and calculate the difference.
4. Edge cases: All digits in the number are '9' (max value is the number itself). The first digit is the only digit or needs to be replaced by '0' for the minimum.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(L) where L is the number of digits, due to string operations. Space complexity is O(L) for storing string representations.
