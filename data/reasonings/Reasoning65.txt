1. Problem summary: Determine if a given string represents a valid number according to the problem's defined rules.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: String parsing, state machine.
3. Step-by-step approach: Define helper functions to scan for integers and unsigned integers. Parse the input string sequentially, checking for optional signs, digits, a decimal point, and an exponent. Ensure that the components are valid according to the rules.
4. Edge cases: Empty string, string with only a sign, string with only a dot, multiple signs, invalid characters, exponent without preceding digits.
5. Time and space complexity: O(n) time complexity, where n is the length of the string, due to the single pass. O(1) space complexity, as we use a constant amount of extra space.
