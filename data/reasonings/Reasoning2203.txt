1. Problem summary: Find the minimum weight subgraph that allows paths from both src1 and src2 to dest.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Shortest path algorithm (Dijkstra's) on a directed graph with weights.
3. Step-by-step approach: Calculate shortest paths from src1 to all nodes, from src2 to all nodes, and from dest to all nodes (by reversing edges). Then, iterate through all nodes 'i' and sum the shortest path weights from src1 to 'i', src2 to 'i', and 'i' to dest, finding the minimum total sum.
4. Edge cases: If no path exists from src1 or src2 to dest, or if a required intermediate path doesn't exist, the minimum weight will remain infinity, indicating no solution.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(E log V) for Dijkstra's, repeated thrice, plus O(V) for iteration, resulting in O(E log V). Space complexity is O(V + E) for storing the graph and distances.
