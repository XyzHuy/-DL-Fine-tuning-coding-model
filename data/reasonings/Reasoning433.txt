1. Problem summary: Find the minimum number of mutations to transform a start gene to an end gene, given a bank of valid gene mutations, where each mutation is a single character change.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Graph traversal / Breadth-First Search (BFS). The gene strings can be seen as nodes, and valid mutations as edges.
3. Step-by-step approach: Use BFS to explore possible gene mutations, starting from the startGene. Maintain a queue of gene strings and their mutation counts. At each step, generate all possible one-character mutations of the current gene. If a mutation is in the bank and hasn't been visited, add it to the queue with an incremented mutation count. Return the mutation count when the endGene is reached.
4. Edge cases: If the endGene cannot be reached, return -1. The startGene might not be present in the bank, but it's a valid starting point.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(B * 8 * 3), where B is the number of genes in the bank, 8 is the length of the gene and 3 is the number of possible mutations for each character. Space complexity is O(B) for the queue and visited set in the worst case.
