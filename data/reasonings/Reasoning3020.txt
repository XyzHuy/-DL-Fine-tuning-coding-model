1. Problem summary: Find the largest subset of positive integers from a given array that can form a sequence of the form [x, x^2, x^4, ..., x^(2^p), ..., x^4, x^2, x].
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Greedy approach, Hashing (Counter).
3. Step-by-step approach: Count frequencies of all numbers. Handle '1' separately. Iterate through unique numbers, forming geometric progressions (x, x^2, x^4, ...). For each progression, count valid elements considering their frequencies and the required symmetric structure. Keep track of the maximum length found.
4. Edge cases: The number '1' needs special handling due to its multiplicative property. A sequence can be of odd length (peak element is unique or has frequency 1) or even length (peak elements are duplicates or have frequency >= 2).
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(N) due to frequency counting and iterating through unique numbers with logarithmic progression checks. Space complexity is O(N) for storing frequencies.
