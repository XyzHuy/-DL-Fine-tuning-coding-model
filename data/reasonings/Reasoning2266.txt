1. Problem summary: Given a string of pressed keys, count the number of possible original text messages considering the digit-to-letter mapping where a letter's press count depends on its position on the key.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Dynamic Programming.
3. Step-by-step approach: Use dynamic programming where dp[i] represents the number of ways to decode the first i characters of pressedKeys. The base case is dp[0] = 1. For each i, dp[i] is initialized with dp[i-1] (representing the last key being a single letter). Then, check for consecutive identical keys (2, 3, or 4 presses for '7' and '9') and add the corresponding previous dp states (dp[i-2], dp[i-3], dp[i-4]) to dp[i], taking modulo 10^9 + 7 at each step.
4. Edge cases: The input string length is at least 1. The digits are between '2' and '9'. The modulo operation is crucial for large results.
5. Time and space complexity: O(N) time complexity where N is the length of pressedKeys, as we iterate through the string once. O(N) space complexity for the DP array.
