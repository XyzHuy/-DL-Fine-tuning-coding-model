1. Problem summary: Calculate the absolute difference between the sum of array elements and the sum of all digits of all elements in the array.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Array manipulation, summation, string conversion.
3. Step-by-step approach: Iterate through the array, calculate the sum of elements, and for each element, convert it to a string to sum its digits. Finally, return the absolute difference between the two sums.
4. Edge cases: The input array is guaranteed to have at least one element, and all elements are positive integers within a given range. No explicit edge cases beyond standard constraints are mentioned.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(N*logM) where N is the number of elements and M is the maximum value of an element (due to digit extraction), and space complexity is O(1) if we ignore string conversion overhead, or O(logM) for storing the string representation of numbers.
