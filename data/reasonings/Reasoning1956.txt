1. Problem summary: Find the minimum days for any point on an infinite grid to be infected by at least k unique virus variants, where each variant spreads daily to adjacent cells.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Brute force search within a bounding box combined with distance calculations.
3. Step-by-step approach: Iterate through all potential target points within the bounding box defined by the initial virus locations. For each target point, calculate the Manhattan distance (days) for every virus to reach it. Sort these distances and take the k-th smallest. The minimum of these k-th smallest distances across all target points is the answer.
4. Edge cases: The problem guarantees at least 2 unique virus variants and k is at least 2 and at most n. The coordinates are positive. The bounding box approach implicitly handles cases where optimal points might be outside the initial points but within the derived bounds.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(N^3 * logN) due to iterating through bounding box (roughly N*N cells if range is proportional to N) and sorting distances (N log N) for each cell, where N is the number of points. Space complexity is O(N) to store distances for sorting.
