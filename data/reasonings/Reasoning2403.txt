1. Problem summary: Given monster powers and a mana gain mechanic that resets mana and increases gain upon defeating a monster, find the minimum days to defeat all monsters.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Dynamic programming with bitmasking.
3. Step-by-step approach: Use recursion with memoization (DP). The state `dp(mask, gain)` represents the minimum days to defeat remaining monsters (indicated by mask) given the current mana gain. Iterate through undefeated monsters, calculate days to defeat each, and recursively call for the next state.
4. Edge cases: All monsters might require a large number of days if their powers are high and gain starts low. The bitmask handles all possible combinations of defeated monsters.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(N * 2^N) due to the bitmask. Space complexity is O(N * 2^N) for the memoization table.
