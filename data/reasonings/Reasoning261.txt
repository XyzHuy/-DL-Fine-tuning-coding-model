1. Problem summary: Determine if a given graph represented by a number of nodes and a list of edges is a valid tree.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Graph Theory / Union Find
3. Step-by-step approach: First, check if the number of edges is exactly n-1. If not, it can't be a tree. Then use the Union Find algorithm to detect cycles. Iterate through the edges and union the nodes. If union returns false (meaning the nodes are already in the same component), a cycle is detected. Finally, if no cycles are found, it's a valid tree.
4. Edge cases: Empty graph (n=0, edges=[] is not explicitly handled but should be considered). Graphs with self-loops or repeated edges are excluded by the problem constraints. Disconnected graphs will have fewer than n-1 edges and will be caught by the initial edge count check.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(E * α(N)) where E is the number of edges and α is the inverse Ackermann function, which grows very slowly, so it's almost O(E). Space complexity is O(N) due to the UnionFind data structure.
