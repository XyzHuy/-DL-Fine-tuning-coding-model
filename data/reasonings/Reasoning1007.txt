1. Problem summary: Given two arrays representing the top and bottom halves of dominoes, find the minimum number of rotations to make all values in either the top or bottom row equal. Return -1 if impossible.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Array manipulation, Greedy.
3. Step-by-step approach: Check if it's possible to make all tops or bottoms equal to tops[0] or bottoms[0]. For each possible value (tops[0] and bottoms[0]), iterate through the dominoes and count the rotations needed. If a value cannot be placed in either the top or bottom, the arrangement is impossible. Return the minimum rotations or -1 if impossible.
4. Edge cases: When the input arrays are empty, or it's impossible to make all values in either top or bottom row equal to some value.
5. Time and space complexity: Time: O(n), where n is the length of the arrays. Space: O(1).
