1. Problem summary: Given a dictionary of root words and a sentence, replace words in the sentence with the shortest root word that prefixes them.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: String manipulation, prefix matching, dictionary lookup.
3. Step-by-step approach: Sort the dictionary by root word length. Split the sentence into words. Iterate through the words in the sentence, and for each word, iterate through the sorted dictionary. If a root word is a prefix of the current word, replace the word with that root and stop searching. If no root is found, keep the original word. Finally, join the replaced words back into a sentence.
4. Edge cases: Empty dictionary, empty sentence, no root found for a word, multiple roots possible (choose shortest).
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(N * M * K), where N is the number of words in the sentence, M is the number of roots in the dictionary, and K is the average length of a word/root. Sorting the dictionary takes O(M log M). Space complexity is O(N + M), for storing the split sentence and the sorted dictionary.
