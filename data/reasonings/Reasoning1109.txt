1. Problem summary: Given flight bookings with start, end, and seat counts, calculate the total seats booked for each flight.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Array manipulation, prefix sum.
3. Step-by-step approach: Use an array to store seat changes at the start and end of booking ranges, then compute the prefix sum to determine the total seats for each flight.
4. Edge cases: Empty bookings array, single flight bookings, overlapping bookings.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(n + m) where n is the number of flights and m is the number of bookings. Space complexity is O(n).
