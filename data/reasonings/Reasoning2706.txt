1. Problem summary: Given an array of chocolate prices and an amount of money, find the minimum cost to buy exactly two chocolates such that the remaining money is non-negative. Return the remaining money or the initial money if buying two chocolates is not possible.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Greedy, Sorting.
3. Step-by-step approach: Sort the prices array in ascending order. Calculate the sum of the two smallest prices. If the initial money is greater than or equal to this sum, subtract the sum from the money and return the result. Otherwise, return the initial money.
4. Edge cases: The array has at least two elements, ensuring we can always pick two chocolates. The cost of the two cheapest chocolates might exceed the available money.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is dominated by sorting, which is O(N log N), where N is the number of chocolate prices. Space complexity is O(1) if sorting is done in-place, or O(N) if a copy is made.
