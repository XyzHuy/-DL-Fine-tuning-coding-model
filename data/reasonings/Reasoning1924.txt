1. Problem summary: Find the smallest circle that encloses all given tree points.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Computational Geometry, Smallest Enclosing Circle (or Minimum Enclosing Disk) problem, solved using Welzl's algorithm.
3. Step-by-step approach: Implement Welzl's algorithm, which recursively finds the minimum enclosing disk. The base cases involve handling 0, 1, 2, or 3 points to define a disk. For more points, it recursively checks if the current point is inside the disk found for the remaining points, otherwise it includes the current point in the recursive call.
4. Edge cases: No trees (empty input), one tree (disk is a point with radius 0), two trees (disk's diameter is the line segment between them), three collinear trees, and three non-collinear trees.
5. Time and space complexity: Welzl's algorithm has an expected time complexity of O(N), where N is the number of points, and a space complexity of O(N) due to recursion depth.
