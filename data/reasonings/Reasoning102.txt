1. Problem summary: The task is to traverse a binary tree and collect the values of its nodes, grouped by level, from left to right.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: This is a tree traversal problem, specifically solved using Breadth-First Search (BFS) with a queue data structure.
3. Step-by-step approach: Initialize a queue with the root. While the queue is not empty, determine the number of nodes on the current level. Process exactly that many nodes: dequeue each node, add its value to a temporary list for the current level, and enqueue its children. After processing all nodes of the level, add the temporary list to the final result.
4. Edge cases: The main edge case is an empty tree (a null root), which should result in an empty list. The solution handles this with an initial check.
5. Time and space complexity: The time complexity is O(N) because each node is visited once. The space complexity is O(W), where W is the maximum width of the tree, as the queue holds at most one level's nodes at any time. In the worst case of a complete tree, this is O(N).
