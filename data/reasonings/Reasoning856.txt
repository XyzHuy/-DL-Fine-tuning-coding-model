1. Problem summary: Calculate the score of a balanced parentheses string based on the given rules.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Stack data structure, string manipulation, recursion (implicit in the problem definition).
3. Step-by-step approach: Use a stack to keep track of the score at each level of nested parentheses. When encountering an opening parenthesis, push the current score onto the stack and reset the score to 0. When encountering a closing parenthesis, pop the previous score from the stack and add to it either 1 (if the current score is 0, representing "()") or twice the current score (representing "(A)").
4. Edge cases: Empty string is not possible based on the problem constraints. The input string is always balanced.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(n), where n is the length of the string, due to the single pass through the string. Space complexity is O(n) in the worst case, where n is the depth of nested parentheses, due to the stack.
