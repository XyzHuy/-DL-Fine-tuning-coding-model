1. Problem summary: Alice picks either all single-digit or all double-digit numbers from an array. If Alice's sum is greater than Bob's (who gets the rest), Alice wins. Determine if Alice can win.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Array manipulation, conditional logic, summation.
3. Step-by-step approach: Iterate through the input array. Calculate the sum of all single-digit numbers and the sum of all double-digit numbers separately. Alice wins if the sum of single-digit numbers is greater than the sum of double-digit numbers, OR if the sum of double-digit numbers is greater than the sum of single-digit numbers.
4. Edge cases: The constraints state that all numbers are positive integers between 1 and 99, so there are no zero or negative numbers, and no numbers outside the single/double-digit range. An array with only single-digit or only double-digit numbers is handled correctly.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(n) because we iterate through the array once. Space complexity is O(1) because we only use a few variables to store sums.
