1. Problem summary: Calculate the average value of nodes at each level of a given binary tree and return the averages in a list.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Tree traversal, Breadth-First Search (BFS).
3. Step-by-step approach: Use BFS to traverse the tree level by level. For each level, calculate the sum of node values and the number of nodes. Compute the average and store it in a list. Return the list of averages.
4. Edge cases: Empty tree (root is None).
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(N) where N is the number of nodes in the tree, as each node is visited once. Space complexity is O(W) where W is the maximum width of the tree (maximum number of nodes at any level), due to the queue used for BFS.
