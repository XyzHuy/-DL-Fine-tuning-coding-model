1. Problem summary: Given a list of points, return the k closest points to the origin (0,0).
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Heap / Priority Queue.
3. Step-by-step approach: Calculate the Euclidean distance for each point, store distances with their points, and then use a min-heap (heapq.nsmallest) to find the k smallest distances and return the corresponding points.
4. Edge cases: Empty input list, k is greater than the number of points. These are implicitly handled correctly because heapq.nsmallest handles edge cases like an empty list or k being larger than the list size.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(N log k) due to heapq.nsmallest. Space complexity is O(k) to store the heap.
