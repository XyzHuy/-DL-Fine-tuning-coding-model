1. Problem summary: Find the maximum sum of elements in a 3x3 hourglass shape within a given m x n matrix.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Iteration and brute force with direct calculation.
3. Step-by-step approach: Iterate through all possible top-left corners of a 3x3 hourglass. For each potential top-left corner (i, j), calculate the sum of the 7 elements forming the hourglass. Keep track of the maximum sum found so far.
4. Edge cases: The matrix dimensions must be at least 3x3 for any hourglass to exist. The iteration bounds correctly handle this by ensuring (i+2) and (j+2) are within matrix bounds.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(m*n) because each element is visited a constant number of times. Space complexity is O(1) as only a few variables are used.
