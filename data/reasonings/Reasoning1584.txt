1. Problem summary: Find the minimum total Manhattan distance to connect all given points on a 2D plane, forming a single connected component.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) problem, specifically using Kruskal's algorithm.
3. Step-by-step approach: Calculate the Manhattan distance between all pairs of points, create a list of all possible edges with their weights, sort these edges by weight, and then use a Union-Find data structure to iteratively add the cheapest edges that do not form a cycle until all points are connected.
4. Edge cases: A single point (no connections needed, cost is 0), all points already collinear (though Kruskal's handles this implicitly). The constraints ensure at least one point and distinct points.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is dominated by edge calculation and sorting, O(N^2 log N), where N is the number of points. Space complexity is O(N^2) to store edges and O(N) for Union-Find.
