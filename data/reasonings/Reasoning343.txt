1. Problem summary: Given an integer n, find the maximum product after breaking it into the sum of at least two positive integers.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Dynamic Programming.
3. Step-by-step approach: Use a DP array to store the maximum product achievable for each number from 1 to n. Iterate from 2 to n, and for each number i, iterate through all possible breakpoints j from 1 to i-1. Update dp[i] with the maximum of j * (i - j) (not breaking (i-j) further) and j * dp[i - j] (breaking (i-j) further). Base cases are handled for n=2 and n=3.
4. Edge cases: n=2 and n=3 are base cases that need to be handled specifically because directly applying the general DP approach would not yield the correct results for small values of n.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(n^2) due to the nested loops. Space complexity is O(n) for the DP array.
