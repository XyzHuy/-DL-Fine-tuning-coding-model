1. Problem summary: Determine if a string containing '(', ')', and '*' is valid, where '*' can be treated as '(', ')', or empty string.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: String manipulation, stack (implied), greedy approach.
3. Step-by-step approach: Iterate through the string, maintaining a low and high count of open parentheses. Treat '*' as ')' for low and '(' for high. If high goes negative, it's invalid. Keep low non-negative. The string is valid if low is 0 at the end.
4. Edge cases: Empty string, string with only '*', string with mismatched parentheses, string starting with ')'.
5. Time and space complexity: O(n) time, O(1) space.
