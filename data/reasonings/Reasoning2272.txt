1. Problem summary: Find the maximum difference in counts between any two characters within any substring of a given string.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: String manipulation, Kadane's algorithm variation, permutations.
3. Step-by-step approach: Iterate through all possible pairs of distinct characters (x, y) from the unique characters in the string. For each pair, perform a single pass through the string to find the maximum variance. This pass uses a modified Kadane's-like approach: maintain counts of x and y, reset counts if y count exceeds x count, and update max variance. Handle cases where x appears but y doesn't and vice-versa. Also, consider the case where one character appears at the end and the other does not, requiring a final adjustment.
4. Edge cases: String with only one unique character (variance is 0). String where all characters appear equally often (variance is 0). Pairs where one character is absent from the string.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(26^2 * N) where N is the length of the string, due to iterating over all character pairs and then the string. Space complexity is O(26) for storing unique characters and counts.
