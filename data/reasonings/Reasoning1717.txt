1. Problem summary: Maximize points by repeatedly removing "ab" (gain x) or "ba" (gain y) substrings from a given string.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Greedy, Stack-based String Manipulation.
3. Step-by-step approach: Prioritize removing the substring that yields more points. Use a stack to efficiently find and remove instances of the prioritized substring. After exhausting the prioritized substring, process the remaining string for the other substring.
4. Edge cases: String containing only one type of character, empty string (not possible by constraints), string with alternating characters.
5. Time and space complexity: Time O(N), Space O(N) where N is the length of the string s.
