1. Problem summary: Given a complete binary tree, count the number of nodes in the tree.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Tree traversal, recursion.
3. Step-by-step approach: Recursively count the nodes by adding 1 (for the current node) to the count of the left subtree and the count of the right subtree. The base case is when the root is None, return 0.
4. Edge cases: Empty tree (root is None).
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(n) because it visits each node once. Space complexity is O(h) where h is the height of the tree, due to the recursion stack.
