1. Problem summary: Simulate a robot's movement on an infinite grid based on a series of commands, avoiding obstacles, and determine the maximum squared Euclidean distance from the origin.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Simulation, Array processing, Geometry.
3. Step-by-step approach: Initialize robot position and direction. Iterate through the commands. If the command is a turn, update the direction. If the command is a move, move one unit at a time, checking for obstacles at each step. Update the maximum squared distance after each command or obstacle encounter. Use a set for efficient obstacle lookup.
4. Edge cases: Empty obstacle list, obstacles at the origin, multiple consecutive turns.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(N*K + O), where N is the number of commands, K is the maximum move length, and O is the number of obstacles. Space complexity is O(O) for storing the obstacles in a set.
