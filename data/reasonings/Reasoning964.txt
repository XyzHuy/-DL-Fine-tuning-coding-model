1. Problem summary: Find the minimum number of operations (+, -, *, /) to express a target number using only a given number x, adhering to operator precedence and disallowing unary negation.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Dynamic Programming (specifically, recursion with memoization or top-down dynamic programming).
3. Step-by-step approach: Use recursion with memoization to explore possible expressions. The base case is when target <= x, in which case the cost can be directly computed. For larger targets, find the largest power of x less than or equal to the target, and consider either adding or subtracting that power of x. Memoize the results of the recursive calls to avoid recomputation.
4. Edge cases: The target can be smaller than x, equal to x, or much larger than x. Need to handle the division operation implicitly by subtracting from a larger power of x.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(log_x(target)) due to the depth of the recursion. Space complexity is O(log_x(target)) due to the memoization cache and the recursive call stack.
