1. Problem summary: Calculate the maximum absolute distance from the origin after a series of moves, where '_' can be either 'L' or 'R'.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Greedy approach, String manipulation.
3. Step-by-step approach: Count 'L', 'R', and '_' characters. To maximize distance, assign all '_' to the direction that has more initial moves. Calculate the net displacement by subtracting the counts of 'L' and 'R' and adding the wildcard count.
4. Edge cases: The input string contains only 'L', 'R', and '_'. The length of the string is at least 1.
5. Time and space complexity: Time is O(n) due to counting characters. Space is O(1) as only a few counters are used.
