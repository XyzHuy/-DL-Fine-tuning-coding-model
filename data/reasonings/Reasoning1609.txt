1. Problem summary: Determine if a binary tree adheres to alternating parity and strictly increasing/decreasing node values across levels.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Tree Traversal (Level Order Traversal / Breadth-First Search).
3. Step-by-step approach: Perform a level-order traversal. For each level, check if nodes have the correct parity (odd for even levels, even for odd levels) and if their values are strictly increasing (even levels) or decreasing (odd levels).
4. Edge cases: An empty tree, a tree with only a root node.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(N) where N is the number of nodes, as each node is visited once. Space complexity is O(W) where W is the maximum width of the tree, for the queue. In the worst case (a complete binary tree), W can be O(N).
