1. Problem summary: Count the number of empty cells in an m x n grid that are not visible to any guard, considering walls as obstructions.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Grid traversal, simulation, brute force.
3. Step-by-step approach: Initialize a grid, mark walls and guards. For each guard, simulate their line of sight in all four directions, marking any reachable empty cell as guarded. Finally, count the remaining unmarked empty cells.
4. Edge cases: Grids with no guards, grids with no walls, guards or walls placed at the edges of the grid, guards or walls completely surrounding an area.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(m*n*k) where k is the number of guards, due to simulating sightlines for each guard. Space complexity is O(m*n) for storing the grid.
