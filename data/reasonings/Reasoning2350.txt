1. Problem summary: Find the length of the shortest sequence of dice rolls (1 to k) that is not a subsequence of the given rolls array.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Greedy, Subsequence.
3. Step-by-step approach: Iterate through the rolls array, maintaining a set of unique numbers encountered since the last full sequence. When all k unique numbers are seen, increment the result count and clear the set. The final answer is the count plus one.
4. Edge cases: An empty rolls array is not possible due to constraints. If k is 1, the answer is always 2 (unless rolls are empty, which is not allowed). The problem implies k >= 1.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(n) because we iterate through the rolls array once. Space complexity is O(k) to store unique rolls seen in the current window.
