1. Problem summary: Find the second largest unique numerical digit in an alphanumeric string.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: String manipulation, Set, Sorting.
3. Step-by-step approach: Iterate through the string, collect all unique digits into a set, convert the set to a sorted list in descending order, and return the element at index 1 if the list has at least two elements, otherwise return -1.
4. Edge cases: The string might contain no digits, only one unique digit, or only non-digit characters.
5. Time and space complexity: O(N) time complexity where N is the length of the string, and O(1) space complexity because the set will store at most 10 unique digits.
