1. Problem summary: Maximize the number of alloys producible using one of k machines within a given budget, considering initial stock and purchase costs for n metal types.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Binary Search on Answer, Greedy.
3. Step-by-step approach: For each machine, perform a binary search to find the maximum number of alloys that can be produced. Within the binary search, a helper function checks if a given number of alloys is producible within budget by calculating the cost of purchasing necessary metals, considering existing stock. The overall maximum across all machines is returned.
4. Edge cases: Zero initial stock for any metal type, budget is zero, composition requiring zero units of a metal type.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(k * n * log(budget + max_stock)) due to iterating through k machines, checking n metals for each alloy count, and binary search. Space complexity is O(1) excluding input storage.
