1. Problem summary: Traverse a matrix in a diagonal order and return the elements in a list.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Matrix traversal.
3. Step-by-step approach: Initialize row and column indices, and a direction variable. Iterate through the matrix, adding elements to the result list. Update the row and column based on the direction, handling boundary conditions to change the direction.
4. Edge cases: Empty matrix.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(m*n) where m and n are the dimensions of the matrix. Space complexity is O(1) excluding the output array, O(m*n) including the output array.
