1. Problem summary: Find the first character that appears for the second time in a given string.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: String manipulation, Hash Set (or Dictionary).
3. Step-by-step approach: Iterate through the string character by character. Use a set to keep track of characters encountered so far. If the current character is already in the set, it means it's the second occurrence, so return it. Otherwise, add the current character to the set.
4. Edge cases: The problem guarantees that there will always be at least one character that appears twice, and the string length is at least 2. No empty string or string with all unique characters is possible.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(n) because we iterate through the string once. Space complexity is O(k) where k is the number of unique characters (at most 26 for lowercase English letters), for storing characters in the set.
