1. Problem summary: Alice and Bob take turns removing substrings with an odd (Alice) or even (Bob) number of vowels from a string. The player who cannot move loses. Determine if Alice wins assuming optimal play.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Game Theory (Nim game variant), String manipulation, Counting.
3. Step-by-step approach: Count the total number of vowels in the initial string. Alice wins if she can make the first move (i.e., if there's at least one substring with an odd number of vowels). If the total vowel count is odd, Alice can always remove all vowels, leaving an even count for Bob. If the total vowel count is even, Bob can potentially remove everything leaving an odd count for Alice or leave an empty string. The key insight is that if there are any vowels, Alice can remove a substring with an odd number of vowels. If there are no vowels, Alice cannot move and loses.
4. Edge cases: The string might contain no vowels at all. If so, Alice cannot make a move and loses. If the string is empty, no moves are possible.
5. Time and space complexity: O(N) time to count vowels, O(1) space.
