1. Problem summary: Determine which receptor (0, 1, or 2) a laser beam from the southwest corner of a square room will hit first, given the room's side length p and the initial point q on the east wall where the beam first hits.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Geometry, Number Theory (GCD)
3. Step-by-step approach: Calculate the number of reflections required for the ray to hit a receptor using the least common multiple concept. Determine `n` as `p // gcd(p, q)` and `m` as `n * q // p`. Based on the parity of `m` and `n`, return the corresponding receptor number (0, 1, or 2).
4. Edge cases: Cases where p and q are equal, or q is a factor of p should be handled correctly by the GCD calculation.
5. Time and space complexity: The time complexity is O(log(min(p, q))) due to the GCD calculation. The space complexity is O(1) as it only uses a few constant space variables.
