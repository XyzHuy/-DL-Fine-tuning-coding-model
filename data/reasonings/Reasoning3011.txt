1. Problem summary: Determine if an array of positive integers can be sorted in ascending order by swapping adjacent elements that have the same number of set bits.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Array manipulation, Sorting, Bit manipulation.
3. Step-by-step approach: For each element, count its set bits. Group elements by their set bit count. Within each group, elements can be rearranged arbitrarily. Check if the overall sorted order can be achieved by sorting within these groups. This can be done by iterating through the array and ensuring that elements only swap with adjacent ones that have the same bit count, effectively performing a bubble sort restricted by the bit count. Finally, check if the array is sorted.
4. Edge cases: An already sorted array is a trivial case. Arrays with all elements having the same bit count can be fully sorted. Arrays with elements that cannot be moved past each other due to different bit counts will result in false.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(N^2) due to the nested loops for sorting (simulating bubble sort). Space complexity is O(N) to store the numbers along with their set bit counts.
