1. Problem summary: Given a connected graph with some edges having unknown positive weights (-1), assign positive integer weights to these unknown edges such that the shortest path distance between a source and destination node equals a given target. Return the modified edges or an empty list if impossible.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Graph traversal, Shortest Path Algorithms (Dijkstra's), Greedy approach.
3. Step-by-step approach: First, calculate the shortest distance using only edges with positive weights. If this distance is already greater than the target, it's impossible. Otherwise, iterate through edges with weight -1. For each such edge, initially assign it a weight of 1. Recalculate the shortest distance. If the new distance is less than or equal to the target, adjust the weight of this edge to bridge the gap between the current shortest distance and the target. If after assigning weights of 1 to all -1 edges, the shortest distance is still greater than the target, then it's impossible.
4. Edge cases: The graph might already have a shortest path greater than the target even with minimum possible weights (1) for unknown edges. All unknown edges could potentially need to be assigned the minimum weight of 1. The shortest path might be achievable without modifying any -1 edges.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is dominated by multiple Dijkstra runs. If k is the number of edges with weight -1, it's O(k * (E log V) or k * (V^2)) depending on Dijkstra implementation. Space complexity is O(V^2) for adjacency matrix or O(V+E) for adjacency list, plus O(V) for distance arrays.
