1. Problem summary: Minimize the bitwise OR of remaining elements in an array after performing at most k bitwise AND operations between adjacent elements.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Binary Search on Answer, Bit Manipulation, Greedy.
3. Step-by-step approach: Use binary search to find the minimum possible bitwise OR value. For a given `target` OR value, check if it's achievable within `k` operations using a greedy approach. Iterate through the array, maintaining a `current` bitwise AND of the subarray. If `current` AND `target` equals `target` (meaning all bits in `target` are covered), reset `current`. Otherwise, increment an operation count if a new subarray must start.
4. Edge cases: Array with a single element, `k` equal to `nums.length - 1` (can merge all elements), all elements are the same, `k` is 0 (no operations allowed).
5. Time and space complexity: O(log(max_val) * n), where max_val is the maximum possible value in nums and n is the length of nums. Space complexity is O(1).
