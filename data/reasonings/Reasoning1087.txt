1. Problem summary: Given a string with character options enclosed in curly braces, generate all possible strings by combining the options and return them in lexicographical order.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: String manipulation, backtracking, depth-first search.
3. Step-by-step approach: First, parse the input string and store the character options into a list of lists. Then, use depth-first search (DFS) to explore all possible combinations of characters. Finally, sort the resulting strings lexicographically.
4. Edge cases: Empty input string, string with no options (only single characters).
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(N * M), where N is the number of possible strings and M is the length of the input string. Space complexity is O(N * M) for storing the generated strings and intermediate data structures.
