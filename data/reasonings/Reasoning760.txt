1. Problem summary: Given two anagrams nums1 and nums2, return an array mapping where mapping[i] = j if nums1[i] = nums2[j].
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Hash table / Array.
3. Step-by-step approach: Create a hash map to store the indices of each element in nums2. Iterate through nums1 and for each element, find its corresponding index in nums2 using the hash map.
4. Edge cases: Empty arrays. Duplicate values in arrays.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(n), where n is the length of the arrays, because we iterate through both arrays once. Space complexity is O(n) due to the hash map storing indices of nums2.
