1. Problem summary: Calculate the day number of the year given a date string in YYYY-MM-DD format.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Date manipulation, array summation.
3. Step-by-step approach: Parse the year, month, and day from the input string. Determine if the year is a leap year. Sum the number of days in the preceding months and add the current day to find the day of the year.
4. Edge cases: Leap year needs to be handled to correctly add days for February. The date range is limited to 1900-2019, simplifying the leap year check.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(1) because the number of months is constant. Space complexity is O(1) as the days_in_month array has a fixed size.
