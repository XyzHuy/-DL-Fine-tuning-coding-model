1. Problem summary: Given a string s, find the shortest possible encoding of the string using the rule k[encoded_string].
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Dynamic Programming, String Compression.
3. Step-by-step approach: Use dynamic programming to store the shortest encoding of substrings. For each substring, check if it can be represented as k[encoded_string] where encoded_string is a repeated substring. Also, consider splitting the substring into two parts and combining their encoded forms.
4. Edge cases: Empty string, strings that cannot be compressed, strings that are already optimally compressed.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(n^3) and space complexity is O(n^2) due to memoization.
