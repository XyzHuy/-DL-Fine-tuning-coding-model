1. Problem summary: Find the largest possible even sum of a subsequence of length k from a given integer array.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Greedy, Sorting, Subsequence.
3. Step-by-step approach: Separate numbers into even and odd lists, sort both in descending order. Iterate through possible counts of odd numbers to include (must be even to maintain an even sum), ensuring the total count with even numbers reaches k. Calculate sums for each valid combination and track the maximum even sum.
4. Edge cases: When no subsequence of length k can form an even sum, or when there aren't enough even or odd numbers to satisfy the length k requirement.
5. Time and space complexity: Time O(N log N) due to sorting, space O(N) for storing even and odd numbers.
