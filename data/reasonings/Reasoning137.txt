1. Problem summary: Find the unique number in an array where every other number appears exactly three times.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Bit manipulation.
3. Step-by-step approach: Iterate through each bit position (0-31). For each position, count how many numbers in the array have that bit set. Take the count modulo 3. If the result is non-zero, it means the single number has that bit set. Reconstruct the single number based on these bits. Handle the sign bit separately.
4. Edge cases: Empty array, array with only one element, negative numbers.
5. Time and space complexity: Time: O(n), where n is the length of the input array. Space: O(1).
