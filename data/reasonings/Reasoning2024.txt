1. Problem summary: Find the maximum length of consecutive identical characters ('T' or 'F') achievable by changing at most k characters in a given string.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Sliding Window.
3. Step-by-step approach: For each target character ('T' and 'F'), use a sliding window to find the longest subarray where the count of the other character is at most k. The maximum length obtained from both targets is the answer.
4. Edge cases: The string length can be 1, k can be equal to the string length, and the string can consist of all identical characters.
5. Time and space complexity: Time O(N) because the sliding window iterates through the string twice. Space O(1) as only a few variables are used.
