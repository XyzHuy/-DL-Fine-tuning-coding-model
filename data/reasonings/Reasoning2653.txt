1. Problem summary: Find the x-th smallest negative number in each subarray of size k, or 0 if there are fewer than x negative numbers.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Sliding window with ordered data structure.
3. Step-by-step approach: Use a sliding window of size k. Maintain a sorted list of negative numbers within the current window. For each window, if the sorted list has at least x elements, append the x-th element; otherwise, append 0.
4. Edge cases: Subarrays with fewer than x negative numbers, windows at the start and end of the array.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(N log K) due to sorted list operations within the sliding window; space complexity is O(K) to store negative numbers in the window.
