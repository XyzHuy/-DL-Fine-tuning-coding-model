1. Problem summary: Find the maximum sum of digits on a path from 'S' (bottom-right) to 'E' (top-left) on a grid, and the number of such paths, avoiding 'X' obstacles. Moves allowed are up, left, and up-left.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Dynamic Programming, Grid Traversal.
3. Step-by-step approach: Use a 2D DP table to store the maximum score and count of paths to reach each cell. Iterate from the bottom-right ('S') towards the top-left ('E'), considering moves from adjacent cells (down, right, down-right) that lead to the current cell. Update the score and path count for the current cell based on the maximum score and corresponding counts from these preceding cells. The DP state for cell (i, j) will be [max_score, path_count].
4. Edge cases: No path exists between 'S' and 'E', encountering an 'X' obstacle, board dimensions (minimum 2x2).
5. Time and space complexity: O(N*N) time for iterating through the grid, O(N*N) space for the DP table, where N is the dimension of the square board.
