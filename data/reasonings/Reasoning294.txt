1. Problem summary: Determine if the first player can always win the Flip Game given an initial string of '+' and '-' characters, where players flip "++" to "--".
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Game Theory, Recursion with Memoization (Dynamic Programming).
3. Step-by-step approach: Use recursion to simulate all possible moves. Memoize the results for each state to avoid redundant calculations. If, from a given state, the current player can make a move that leads to the opponent losing, then the current player wins.
4. Edge cases: String with length less than 2, string with no "++" sequences.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(N^2) due to memoization and string slicing, where N is the length of the input string. Space complexity is O(N) due to the memoization dictionary storing states and the recursion depth.
