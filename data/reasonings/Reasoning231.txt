1. Problem summary: Determine if a given integer is a power of two.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Bit manipulation.
3. Step-by-step approach: Check if the number is positive. Then, use the bitwise AND operator to check if the number has only one set bit. If n & (n-1) is 0, then n is a power of 2.
4. Edge cases: Handle cases where n is zero or negative.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(1) because the bitwise operation takes constant time. Space complexity is O(1) as it uses constant extra space.
