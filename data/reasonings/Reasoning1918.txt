1. Problem summary: Find the kth smallest sum among all possible contiguous subarrays of a given integer array.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Binary Search on Answer, Sliding Window.
3. Step-by-step approach: Binary search for the possible subarray sum. For a given `mid` sum, use a sliding window to count how many subarray sums are less than or equal to `mid`. If the count is at least `k`, it means the kth smallest sum could be `mid` or smaller, so we search in the lower half. Otherwise, we search in the upper half. The sliding window efficiently counts subarrays with sums up to `s` by expanding the right end and shrinking the left end when the sum exceeds `s`.
4. Edge cases: The minimum possible subarray sum is the smallest element in `nums`. The maximum possible subarray sum is the sum of all elements in `nums`. `k` can be as large as the total number of subarrays.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(N * log(Sum)), where N is the length of nums and Sum is the total sum of nums. Space complexity is O(1).
