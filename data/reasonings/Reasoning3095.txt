1. Problem summary: Find the shortest non-empty subarray whose elements' bitwise OR is at least k.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Brute Force, Subarray Iteration.
3. Step-by-step approach: Iterate through all possible start indices, and for each start, iterate through all possible end indices. Calculate the bitwise OR for the current subarray and if it's >= k, update the minimum length found so far and break the inner loop.
4. Edge cases: If no subarray satisfies the condition, return -1. Empty input array is not possible due to constraints. k=0 means any non-empty subarray is special.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(n^2) due to nested loops. Space complexity is O(1).
