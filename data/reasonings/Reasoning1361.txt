1. Problem summary: Determine if a given set of node relationships (leftChild, rightChild) forms exactly one valid binary tree.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Graph traversal (DFS/BFS), Union-Find.
3. Step-by-step approach: Calculate in-degrees of all nodes. Identify a single node with an in-degree of 0 as the potential root. Perform a traversal (like DFS) starting from the root to detect cycles and count visited nodes. Finally, ensure all nodes were visited and all other nodes have an in-degree of 1.
4. Edge cases: No nodes (n=0), multiple roots, cycles in connections, disconnected components, nodes having more than one parent.
5. Time and space complexity: O(N) time for calculating in-degrees and traversal, O(N) space for storing in-degrees and visited status.
