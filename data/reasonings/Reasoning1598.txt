1. Problem summary: Simulate folder operations and determine how many "../" operations are needed to return to the root directory.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Simulation, Stack (conceptual).
3. Step-by-step approach: Initialize a counter for depth. Iterate through logs. If "../", decrement depth but not below zero. If a folder name (not "./" or "../"), increment depth. The final depth is the answer.
4. Edge cases: Starting at the root directory and encountering "../" should keep depth at 0. Empty logs or logs that only go up and down to root.
5. Time and space complexity: O(N) time where N is the number of logs, O(1) space.
