1. Problem summary: The problem asks us to replace all occurrences of '.' in a given IPv4 address string with '[.]'.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: String manipulation / String replacement.
3. Step-by-step approach: The solution uses the string's built-in replace method to replace all occurrences of '.' with '[.]'.
4. Edge cases: The problem statement specifies that the input is a valid IPv4 address, so no input validation is needed.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(n), where n is the length of the input string, due to the string replacement. Space complexity is O(n) as the `replace` method creates a new string.
