1. Problem summary: Given a list of buildings represented by their left edge, right edge, and height, construct the skyline formed by these buildings.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Divide and Conquer / Heap / Line Sweep Algorithm
3. Step-by-step approach: Create a sorted list of critical points (start and end of buildings). Use a heap to track the current heights of active buildings. Iterate through the critical points, updating the heap with building starts and ends, and adding new key points to the skyline.
4. Edge cases: Overlapping buildings, buildings with the same start or end points, empty input.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(n log n) due to sorting and heap operations. Space complexity is O(n) to store critical points and the heap.
