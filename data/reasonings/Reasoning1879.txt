1. Problem summary: Minimize the total XOR sum of pairs formed by elements from two arrays of equal length by rearranging one of the arrays.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Dynamic Programming with Bitmasking, State Compression.
3. Step-by-step approach: Use a recursive function with memoization (dynamic programming). The state will represent the current index in nums1 and a bitmask indicating which elements of nums2 have already been used. For each element in nums1, iterate through all unused elements in nums2, calculate the XOR, and recursively call for the next index, updating the mask. The minimum sum is found by taking the minimum over all choices.
4. Edge cases: The constraint n <= 14 suggests that exponential complexity related to n is acceptable. Empty arrays are not possible due to constraints.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(n * 2^n) due to n possible indices and 2^n possible masks. Space complexity is O(n * 2^n) for memoization.
