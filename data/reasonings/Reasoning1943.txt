1. Problem summary: Given a set of colored segments on a number line, where overlapping segments merge colors, find a minimal set of non-overlapping segments representing the mixed colors and their sums.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Sweep Line Algorithm, Interval Management.
3. Step-by-step approach: Create "events" for the start and end of each segment, storing the color to be added or removed. Sort these events by position. Iterate through sorted events, maintaining a running sum of active colors. When the active color sum changes and is greater than zero, output a segment from the previous position to the current position with the previous sum. Update the running sum and the previous position.
4. Edge cases: Segments starting or ending at the same position, handling cases where no segments overlap.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(N log N) due to sorting events, where N is the number of segments. Space complexity is O(N) to store events.
