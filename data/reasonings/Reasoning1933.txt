1. Problem summary: Determine if a digit string can be partitioned into consecutive value-equal substrings, where exactly one substring has length 2 and all others have length 3.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Greedy approach, string manipulation.
3. Step-by-step approach: Iterate through the string, counting consecutive identical characters. If a character changes, check the count of the previous group. A group's count must be a multiple of 3, or have a remainder of 2 if it's the designated length-2 substring. Track if a length-2 substring has already been used. Finally, check the last group.
4. Edge cases: The entire string could be one value-equal substring, or composed of only groups of length 3. The string might start or end with a character that doesn't allow for valid decomposition.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(N) where N is the length of the string, as we iterate through it once. Space complexity is O(1) as we only use a few variables.
