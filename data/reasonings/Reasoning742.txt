1. Problem summary: Find the value of the nearest leaf node to a target node with value k in a given binary tree.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Graph Traversal (BFS), Tree Traversal.
3. Step-by-step approach: First, convert the tree into an undirected graph where each node is connected to its parent and children. Then, perform a Breadth-First Search (BFS) starting from the node with value k to find the nearest leaf node. A leaf node is identified as a node with only one neighbor in the graph (except for the root node which may have only one neighbor and be a leaf).
4. Edge cases: The tree may consist of only one node, which is the root and also the target. The target node might already be a leaf. The root node itself can be a leaf node.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(N), where N is the number of nodes in the tree, due to the conversion to a graph and the BFS traversal. Space complexity is O(N) to store the graph and the visited set during BFS.
