1. Problem summary: Given a linked list and a value x, rearrange the list so that all nodes with values less than x come before all nodes with values greater than or equal to x, preserving the original order within each partition.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Linked list manipulation, partitioning.
3. Step-by-step approach: Create two new linked lists: one for nodes less than x and one for nodes greater than or equal to x. Iterate through the original list, adding each node to the appropriate new list. Finally, connect the two lists.
4. Edge cases: Empty list, list with only one element, x is smaller/larger than all elements, list already partitioned.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(n) because we iterate through the list once. Space complexity is O(1) because we are only using a constant amount of extra space (dummy nodes).
