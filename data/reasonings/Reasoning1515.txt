1. Problem summary: Find a point (x_center, y_center) that minimizes the sum of Euclidean distances to a given set of customer positions.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Geometric optimization, specifically finding a geometric median or Fermat point for Euclidean distances, solved using gradient descent.
3. Step-by-step approach: Initialize a candidate center point (e.g., average of customer coordinates). Iteratively update the center point by moving it in the direction opposite to the gradient of the total distance sum. The step size (alpha) decreases over time, and the process stops when the movement becomes negligible. The gradient for each dimension is calculated by summing the normalized vector components from the candidate center to each customer.
4. Edge cases: A single customer position (center should be at that position). All customers at the same position. Positions with zero coordinates.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is iterative and depends on convergence, but roughly proportional to the number of iterations times the number of customers. Space complexity is O(1) besides input storage.
