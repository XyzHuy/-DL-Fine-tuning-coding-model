1. Problem summary: Find the length of the longest subsequence of a given string `s` where the absolute difference between the alphabetical order of any two adjacent characters is at most `k`.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Dynamic Programming.
3. Step-by-step approach: Iterate through the input string `s`. For each character, determine the maximum length of an ideal subsequence ending with that character by considering all possible previous characters within the `k` difference limit. Maintain a DP array of size 26 to store the maximum lengths ending with each alphabet character. The final answer is the maximum value in this DP array.
4. Edge cases: `k` can be 0, meaning adjacent characters must be the same. `s` can have length 1. `k` can be 25, allowing any adjacent characters.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(N*26) where N is the length of s, effectively O(N). Space complexity is O(26), effectively O(1).
