1. Problem summary: Compress a character array by replacing consecutive repeating characters with the character followed by its count, if the count is greater than 1. Modify the input array in-place and return the new length.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Two Pointers / In-place modification
3. Step-by-step approach: Use two pointers, read_index and write_index. Iterate through the array using read_index, counting consecutive occurrences of each character. When a different character is encountered, write the character and its count (if > 1) to the array using write_index.
4. Edge cases: Empty input array, single character input array, large counts that require multiple digits.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(n) because we iterate through the array. Space complexity is O(1) because we modify the array in-place.
