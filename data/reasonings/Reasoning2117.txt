1. Problem summary: Calculate the product of integers in a given range, abbreviate it by removing trailing zeros and truncating if the result is too long, then append the count of removed zeros.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Number theory, string manipulation, simulation.
3. Step-by-step approach: First, count the factors of 2 and 5 to determine the number of trailing zeros (C). Then, iterate through the range to calculate the prefix and suffix of the product, carefully removing factors of 2 and 5 to avoid overflow. Track if the number of digits exceeds 10. Finally, format the output string based on whether abbreviation is needed.
4. Edge cases: The range can include 1. The product might be very large, requiring careful handling of intermediate calculations to prevent overflow. The number of digits after removing trailing zeros might be exactly 10 or less.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(N * log(max(right))), where N is right - left + 1, due to prime factorization within the loop. Space complexity is O(1) as only a few variables are used.
