1. Problem summary: Simulate an array's dynamic behavior where elements are removed from the left and then appended to the right in a cyclic manner, and answer queries about the array's state at specific times and indices.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Array simulation, modular arithmetic, pattern recognition.
3. Step-by-step approach: Calculate the total cycle length (twice the array length). Determine the current time's position within this cycle using the modulo operator. Based on whether the time falls into the removal or appending phase of the cycle, calculate the effective index and check if it's valid to retrieve the element or return -1.
4. Edge cases: Queries where the requested index is out of bounds for the current state of the array (either due to removal or because the appending phase hasn't reached that index yet).
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(N + Q) where N is the length of nums and Q is the number of queries, as we iterate through queries and perform constant time calculations per query after an initial O(N) implicit setup (though the solution is O(1) per query for processing time). Space complexity is O(1) if we don't count the output array, or O(Q) if we do.
