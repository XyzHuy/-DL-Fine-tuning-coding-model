1. Problem summary: Determine if a string `s` can be partitioned into `k` non-empty palindromic strings using all its characters.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Greedy, Frequency Counting, Palindrome Properties.
3. Step-by-step approach: Count character frequencies. Identify characters with odd counts. The number of characters with odd counts must be less than or equal to `k`. Additionally, `k` cannot exceed the total length of the string.
4. Edge cases: `k` is greater than `s.length`, `k` is equal to `s.length`.
5. Time and space complexity: Time O(N) where N is the length of s, Space O(1) because the alphabet size is fixed.
