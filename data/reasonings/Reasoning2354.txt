1. Problem summary: Count pairs of numbers from an array where the sum of set bits in their bitwise OR and bitwise AND equals or exceeds a threshold k.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Bit manipulation, counting, frequency mapping.
3. Step-by-step approach: First, find the number of set bits for each unique number in nums. Then, iterate through all unique pairs of these set bit counts. If the sum of a pair's set bit counts is at least k, multiply the frequencies of those counts and add to the total result.
4. Edge cases: The array can contain duplicate numbers. The pair can consist of the same number if it appears in the array. The threshold k can be up to 60, which is relevant for 64-bit integers.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(N log M + U^2), where N is the number of elements in nums, M is the maximum value in nums (for counting set bits), and U is the number of unique elements in nums. Space complexity is O(U) to store the counts of set bits.
