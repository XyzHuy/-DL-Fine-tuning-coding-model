1. Problem summary: Find the maximum sum of a non-empty subsequence where consecutive elements are at most k indices apart.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Dynamic Programming with Sliding Window Maximum (using a Deque).
3. Step-by-step approach: Use dynamic programming where dp[i] stores the maximum constrained subset sum ending at index i. To calculate dp[i], consider nums[i] itself and nums[i] plus the maximum dp value within the last k elements. A deque is used to efficiently find the maximum dp value within the sliding window [i-k, i-1].
4. Edge cases: The array can contain negative numbers. The subsequence must be non-empty. If all numbers are negative, the result is the largest single negative number.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(n) because each element is processed once, and deque operations are O(1) amortized. Space complexity is O(n) for the dp array and the deque.
