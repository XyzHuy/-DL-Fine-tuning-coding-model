1. Problem summary: Convert a source string to a target string by changing substrings, given a dictionary of possible transformations and their costs, where operations on disjoint or identical index ranges are allowed.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Dynamic Programming, All-Pairs Shortest Path (Floyd-Warshall).
3. Step-by-step approach: Build a graph where nodes are unique original and changed strings. Use Floyd-Warshall to find the minimum cost to transform any string to any other string. Then, use dynamic programming on the source string's indices, where dp[i] is the minimum cost to convert the prefix of length i of the source string to the corresponding prefix of the target string.
4. Edge cases: The source string cannot be converted to the target string (return -1). Empty original/changed strings or costs. Identical source and target strings.
5. Time and space complexity: O(N^3 + M*L^2), where N is the number of unique strings and L is the maximum length of a string, and M is the length of source/target. Space complexity is O(N^2 + M).
