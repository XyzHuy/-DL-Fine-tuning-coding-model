1. Problem summary: Partition an array of size n (multiple of 3) into n/3 subarrays of size 3, such that the difference between any two elements within a subarray is at most k. Return the partitioned subarrays or an empty list if impossible.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Array partitioning, Greedy approach, Sorting.
3. Step-by-step approach: Sort the input array. Iterate through the sorted array in steps of 3. For each triplet, check if the difference between the largest and smallest element is less than or equal to k. If it is, add the triplet to the result. If not, return an empty list immediately.
4. Edge cases: Array size is already guaranteed to be a multiple of 3. If no valid partition can be formed, an empty array is returned.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is dominated by sorting, O(n log n). Space complexity is O(n) for storing the result, or O(1) if we don't count output space.
