1. Problem summary: Determine if str2 can be made a subsequence of str1 by cyclically incrementing at most one character in str1 for each potential match.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: String manipulation, subsequence checking, greedy approach.
3. Step-by-step approach: Use two pointers, one for str1 and one for str2. Iterate through str1. If str1[i] matches str2[j], advance both pointers. If str1[i] can be incremented to match str2[j], advance both pointers. If str1[i] does not match or cannot become str2[j], only advance the str1 pointer. If the str2 pointer reaches the end of str2, return true.
4. Edge cases: str2 is longer than str1, empty strings (though constraints say they are non-empty), characters at the boundary ('z' incrementing to 'a').
5. Time and space complexity: Time O(N), where N is the length of str1. Space O(1).
