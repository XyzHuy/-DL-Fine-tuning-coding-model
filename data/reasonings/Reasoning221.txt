1. Problem summary: Find the largest square submatrix consisting of only 1's in a given binary matrix and return its area.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Dynamic Programming
3. Step-by-step approach: Create a DP table where dp[i][j] represents the side length of the largest square ending at matrix[i-1][j-1]. Iterate through the matrix, and if matrix[i-1][j-1] is '1', update dp[i][j] as the minimum of its top, left, and top-left neighbors plus 1. Keep track of the maximum side length seen so far and return its square.
4. Edge cases: Empty matrix or a matrix with no '1's.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(m*n) due to the nested loops. Space complexity is O(m*n) for the DP table.
