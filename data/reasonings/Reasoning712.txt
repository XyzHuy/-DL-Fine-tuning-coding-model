1. Problem summary: Find the minimum ASCII sum of deleted characters from two strings to make them equal.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Dynamic Programming.
3. Step-by-step approach: Use a 2D DP table where dp[i][j] stores the minimum ASCII sum to make s1[:i] and s2[:j] equal. Initialize the first row and column of the DP table. Iterate through the table, and if s1[i-1] equals s2[j-1], then dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j-1]. Otherwise, dp[i][j] = min(dp[i-1][j] + ord(s1[i-1]), dp[i][j-1] + ord(s2[j-1])). Return dp[m][n].
4. Edge cases: Empty strings, strings with no common characters.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(m*n) and space complexity is O(m*n), where m and n are the lengths of the input strings s1 and s2, respectively.
