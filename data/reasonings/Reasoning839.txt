1. Problem summary: Given a list of strings that are anagrams of each other, determine the number of similarity groups, where strings are similar if they are identical or can be made identical by swapping at most two letters.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Union Find / Graph Connectivity
3. Step-by-step approach: Use Union Find to connect similar strings. Iterate through all pairs of strings, check if they are similar (differ by at most two swaps), and if so, union them in the Union Find data structure. The number of groups is then the number of disjoint sets (or connected components) in the Union Find. The initial number of groups is the number of strings and then decrement the number of groups during union operations.
4. Edge cases: Empty input list, list with single element, strings that are already similar.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(N^2 * M), where N is the number of strings and M is the length of the strings. Space complexity is O(N) due to the Union Find data structure.
