1. Problem summary: Find the shortest (and lexicographically smallest) path for a ball to reach a hole in a maze, represented by a string of directions.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Graph traversal / Breadth-First Search (BFS) with lexicographical ordering.
3. Step-by-step approach: Use BFS to explore the maze. Keep track of the distance and path to each cell.  When a new, shorter, or lexicographically smaller path to a cell is found, update the distance and path.  If the hole is reachable, return the lexicographically smallest path; otherwise, return "impossible".
4. Edge cases: The ball cannot reach the hole, multiple shortest paths exist (choose the lexicographically smallest).
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(m*n*max(m,n)) because in the worst case, we might visit each cell multiple times while rolling in different directions. Space complexity is O(m*n) for storing distances and paths.
