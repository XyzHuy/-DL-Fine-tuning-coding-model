1. Problem summary: Count binary strings of lengths between minLength and maxLength, where consecutive blocks of 1s have lengths divisible by oneGroup, and consecutive blocks of 0s have lengths divisible by zeroGroup.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Dynamic Programming.
3. Step-by-step approach: Use DP where dp[i] represents the number of good binary strings of length i. To form a string of length i, we can append a block of '1's of size oneGroup or a block of '0's of size zeroGroup to a valid string of length i - oneGroup or i - zeroGroup respectively. The base case is dp[0] = 1 (empty string). Finally, sum dp[i] for i in [minLength, maxLength].
4. Edge cases: The problem statement implies positive integers for lengths and groups. The modulo operation handles large counts. Empty string and lengths less than group sizes are implicitly handled by DP transitions.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(maxLength) due to the single loop iterating up to maxLength. Space complexity is O(maxLength) for the DP table.
