1. Problem summary: Count substrings of a given integer's string representation of length k that are divisors of the original integer.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: String manipulation, number theory (divisibility check).
3. Step-by-step approach: Convert the integer to a string. Iterate through all possible substrings of length k. For each substring, convert it back to an integer. Check if this integer is non-zero and divides the original integer. Increment a counter if both conditions are met.
4. Edge cases: Substrings representing zero are not divisors. The integer itself might be a single digit, or k might be equal to the length of the number's string.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(N * k) where N is the number of digits in num, due to substring extraction and integer conversion. Space complexity is O(N) for storing the string representation of num.
