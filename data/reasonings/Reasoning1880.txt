1. Problem summary: Check if the sum of numerical values of two given words equals the numerical value of a third word, where numerical value is derived from letter positions and concatenation.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: String manipulation, numerical conversion.
3. Step-by-step approach: Define a helper function to convert a word into its numerical value by mapping each letter to its position (0-indexed) and concatenating these values into a string, then converting to an integer. Calculate the numerical values for firstWord, secondWord, and targetWord using this helper. Compare the sum of the first two values with the target value.
4. Edge cases: Words can be of length 1. All words consist of letters 'a' through 'j'. Words can represent 0 numerical value (e.g., "a", "aaa").
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(L1 + L2 + L3) where L1, L2, L3 are the lengths of firstWord, secondWord, and targetWord respectively, due to iterating through each word once. Space complexity is O(L1 + L2 + L3) in the worst case for storing intermediate string representations before integer conversion, although O(1) if considering only auxiliary space beyond input storage.
