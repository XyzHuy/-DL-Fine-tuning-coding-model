1. Problem summary: Find all unique numbers that can be expressed as x^i + y^j, where i and j are non-negative integers, and the resulting number is less than or equal to a given bound.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Math, iteration/looping, set.
3. Step-by-step approach: Iterate through possible values of i and j, calculate x^i + y^j, and add it to a set if it is within the bound. Convert the set to a list and return. Handle the case where x or y is equal to 1 to limit the exponent values.
4. Edge cases: x or y equal to 1. The bound is relatively small.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(log(bound, x) * log(bound, y)). Space complexity is O(number of powerful integers), which is O(log(bound, x) * log(bound, y)) in the worst case.
