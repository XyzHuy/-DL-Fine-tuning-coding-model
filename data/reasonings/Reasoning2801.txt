1. Problem summary: Count stepping numbers within a given string range [low, high], where stepping numbers have adjacent digits differing by exactly 1, excluding leading zeros.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Digit DP (Dynamic Programming on digits) with memoization.
3. Step-by-step approach: Define a recursive DP function `dp(i, is_limit, is_zero, prev_digit)` to count stepping numbers up to a given string `num_str`. The function considers the current digit position `i`, whether we are restricted by the digits of `num_str` (`is_limit`), if we are currently placing leading zeros (`is_zero`), and the previous digit placed (`prev_digit`). The final answer is obtained by calculating `count_up_to(high) - count_up_to(low-1)`.
4. Edge cases: Handling leading zeros during DP. Ensuring the base case correctly returns 1 for a valid number and 0 for an empty number or if `is_zero` is still true at the end. The modulo operation is applied to prevent overflow.
5. Time and space complexity: The state of the DP is (position, is_limit, is_zero, prev_digit). Position goes up to 100, is_limit and is_zero are boolean (2 states each), and prev_digit has 10 possible values. Thus, the time complexity is roughly O(N * 2 * 2 * 10 * 10) where N is the max length of the number string, and space complexity is O(N * 2 * 2 * 10) due to memoization.
