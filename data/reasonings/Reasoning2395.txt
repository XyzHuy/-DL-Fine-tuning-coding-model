1. Problem summary: Find if there are two distinct subarrays of length 2 in an array that have the same sum.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Hash Set (or Dictionary) for detecting duplicates.
3. Step-by-step approach: Iterate through the array, calculate the sum of each pair of adjacent elements (forming subarrays of length 2), and store these sums in a set. If a sum is already present in the set, it means a duplicate sum has been found, and we return true.
4. Edge cases: The input array will always have at least two elements, so a subarray of length 2 is always possible. The constraint ensures array length is at least 2.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(N) because we iterate through the array once. Space complexity is O(N) in the worst case for the set to store sums.
