1. Problem summary: The task is to determine if a given string can be built starting from an empty string by repeatedly inserting the substring "abc" at any position.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: String Manipulation, Simulation.
3. Step-by-step approach: The solution reverses the process described in the problem. Instead of building the string up, it reduces the given string down by repeatedly finding and removing any occurrences of "abc". If the string becomes empty after this process, it means it could have been constructed from "abc" insertions.
4. Edge cases: If after all removals the string is not empty, it's invalid (e.g., "abccba" becomes "aba"). The length is at least 1, so an empty input is not a concern.
5. Time and space complexity: The time complexity is O(N^2) in the worst case, as each find and replace operation can take O(N) time, and this can happen up to N/3 times. The space complexity is O(N) because string replacement in a loop can create new strings.
