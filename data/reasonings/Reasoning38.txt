1. Problem summary: The problem asks to generate the nth element of the count-and-say sequence, where each element is the run-length encoding of the previous element.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: String manipulation, recursion (though an iterative solution is preferred), run-length encoding.
3. Step-by-step approach: Start with the base case "1". Iterate from 2 to n, generating each subsequent sequence by iterating through the previous sequence and counting consecutive identical characters. Append the count and the character to the new sequence.
4. Edge cases: The base case n=1 should return "1". The input n is constrained to be between 1 and 30.
5. Time and space complexity: The time complexity is O(m*n) where n is the input and m is the average length of the string at each iteration. The space complexity is O(m) where m is the length of the final string.
