1. Problem summary: Insert a new node with the greatest common divisor (GCD) of adjacent node values between every pair of adjacent nodes in a linked list.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Linked list manipulation, arithmetic (GCD calculation).
3. Step-by-step approach: Iterate through the linked list. For each node, calculate the GCD of its value and the next node's value. Create a new node with this GCD and insert it between the current node and the next node. Advance the iteration pointer to the node after the newly inserted GCD node.
4. Edge cases: An empty linked list or a linked list with only one node (no adjacent pairs to insert between).
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(N * log(max_val)) due to iterating through N nodes and calculating GCD for each pair. Space complexity is O(1) as new nodes are inserted in-place.
