1. Problem summary: Count strings in a list that start with a given prefix.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: String manipulation, iteration.
3. Step-by-step approach: Initialize a counter to zero. Iterate through each word in the input list. For each word, check if it begins with the specified prefix. If it does, increment the counter. Finally, return the total count.
4. Edge cases: An empty list of words, or a prefix longer than any word in the list.
5. Time and space complexity: Time O(N*M) where N is the number of words and M is the length of the prefix, Space O(1).
