1. Problem summary: Given a string of digits, find the lexicographically smallest string achievable by repeatedly applying two operations: adding a value 'a' to odd-indexed digits (with wrap-around) and rotating the string right by 'b' positions.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Breadth-First Search (BFS) on a state space, where states are strings and transitions are the given operations.
3. Step-by-step approach: Start with the initial string and use a queue for BFS. Maintain a set of visited strings to prevent cycles. In each step, explore two possible new strings by applying the 'add' operation and the 'rotate' operation to the current string. If a new string hasn't been visited, add it to the queue and the visited set. Keep track of the lexicographically smallest string encountered.
4. Edge cases: The string length is at least 2 and even. The operations guarantee that the length remains constant. The digits are always 0-9. The operations may lead to cycles, which are handled by the 'seen' set.
5. Time and space complexity: The maximum number of possible states (strings) is limited. For a string of length N, there are 10^N possible strings, but the operations are constrained. The effective number of reachable states is what matters. With BFS, time complexity is O(N * 10^N) in the worst theoretical case, but practically much smaller due to constraints and operation effects. Space complexity is O(N * Number of reachable states) due to storing visited strings and the queue.
