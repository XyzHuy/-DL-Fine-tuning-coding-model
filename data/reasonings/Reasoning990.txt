1. Problem summary: Determine if a set of equality and inequality equations between single-character variables can be satisfied by assigning integer values to the variables.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Union-Find (Disjoint Set Union)
3. Step-by-step approach: Use Union-Find to group equal variables. Then, iterate through the inequality equations and check if any unequal variables belong to the same group. If so, the equations are unsatisfiable.
4. Edge cases: Empty input, single equation, multiple connected components of equal variables.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(N), where N is the number of equations. Space complexity is O(1) since there are only 26 possible variables.
