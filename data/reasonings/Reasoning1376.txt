1. Problem summary: Calculate the total time required for news to reach all employees in a company, starting from the head, where each manager takes a specific time to inform their direct subordinates. The company structure is a tree.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Tree traversal, Graph traversal (specifically Depth First Search).
3. Step-by-step approach: 1. Build an adjacency list representing the manager-subordinate relationships. 2. Perform a Depth First Search (DFS) starting from the head of the company. 3. In the DFS, for each employee, recursively calculate the maximum time it takes to inform their subordinates. 4. Add the current employee's informTime to the maximum subordinate informTime to get the total time for that branch.
4. Edge cases: A company with only one employee (head) will take 0 minutes. Employees with no subordinates will have a base inform time of 0 for their branch.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(N) because each employee and manager relationship is visited once. Space complexity is O(N) for storing the adjacency list and the recursion stack in the DFS.
