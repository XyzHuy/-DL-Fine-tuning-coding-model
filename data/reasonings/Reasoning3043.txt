1. Problem summary: Find the maximum length of a common prefix string shared by any number from arr1 and any number from arr2.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: String manipulation, Set operations, Brute-force with optimization.
3. Step-by-step approach: Convert each number to a string, generate all its prefixes, store all prefixes from arr1 in a set, store all prefixes from arr2 in another set, find the intersection of these sets, and return the length of the longest string in the intersection.
4. Edge cases: Arrays can be empty (though constraints say length >= 1), numbers can be single digits, no common prefixes exist (return 0).
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is roughly O(N*L^2 + M*L^2) where N and M are array lengths and L is the max number of digits, due to prefix generation and set operations. Space complexity is O(N*L^2 + M*L^2) for storing prefixes.
