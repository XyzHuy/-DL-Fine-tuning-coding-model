1. Problem summary: The goal is to verify if the binary string representations of all numbers from 1 to n exist as substrings within the input string s.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: String, Brute Force.
3. Step-by-step approach: The code iterates through each integer i from 1 to n. For each i, it gets its binary representation and checks if this binary string is a substring of s. If any number is not found, it returns false; if all are found, it returns true.
4. Edge cases: With n up to 10^9, a direct loop from 1 to n can be too slow. The code handles cases where the binary form of a number is longer than s, as the substring check will fail.
5. Time and space complexity: Time is O(n * len(s) * log n) because of iterating n times and performing a substring search. Space is O(log n) for storing the binary string of the current number.
