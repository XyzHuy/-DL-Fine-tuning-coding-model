1. Problem summary: Determine the maximum number of employees that can attend a meeting given that each employee i will only attend if they can sit next to their favorite person favorite[i] at a circular table.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Graph theory, specifically cycle detection and longest path in a DAG. The relationships can be modeled as a functional graph where each node has an out-degree of 1.
3. Step-by-step approach: Decompose the problem into two main cases: cycles and trees leading to nodes in cycles. First, find the maximum length of any simple cycle in the graph, as all nodes in such a cycle can attend. Second, consider nodes not part of any cycle; these form directed trees pointing towards nodes that are part of cycles. For each node that is the favorite of exactly two distinct employees, these two employees can form a pair and potentially extend a cycle. The length of the longest chain of such pairs plus the cycle they connect to contributes to the total. The final answer is the maximum of the largest cycle and the sum of lengths of all such paired branches.
4. Edge cases: Graphs with no cycles, graphs that are entirely one large cycle, graphs with multiple disjoint cycles and branches. The constraint n >= 2 means there will always be at least two employees.
5. Time and space complexity: The solution involves finding cycles (similar to DFS or Floyd's cycle-finding algorithm, O(N)) and topological sort/longest path in DAG (O(N)). Therefore, the overall time complexity is O(N) and space complexity is O(N) for storing visited states and distances.
