1. Problem summary: Evaluate a Lisp-like expression string containing integers, let, add, and mult operations, considering variable scopes.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Recursive parsing, string processing, scope management.
3. Step-by-step approach: Tokenize the expression, recursively parse the tokens, handling integers, add, mult, and let expressions. Maintain a scope dictionary to track variable assignments.
4. Edge cases: Integers, nested let expressions, variable shadowing, empty scope.
5. Time and space complexity: O(n) time complexity, where n is the length of the expression. O(d) space complexity, where d is the maximum depth of nested let expressions.
