1. Problem summary: Find the minimum length of a string after repeatedly removing a character `s[i]` and its closest left and right occurrences if they exist.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: String manipulation, character counting, greedy approach.
3. Step-by-step approach: Count the frequency of each character. For each character, if its count is odd, one instance will remain. If its count is even and greater than 0, all instances can be removed in pairs. The total length is the sum of remaining characters.
4. Edge cases: String with all unique characters (no removals possible), string with repeated characters but no valid removal operations (like "aa").
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity O(N) due to character counting, Space complexity O(1) as the alphabet size is constant.
