1. Problem summary: Determine if an increasing subsequence of length 3 exists within a given integer array.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Array traversal, subsequence detection.
3. Step-by-step approach: Iterate through the array, maintaining the smallest and second smallest numbers seen so far. If a number greater than both is encountered, an increasing triplet exists.
4. Edge cases: Empty array, array with fewer than three elements, all elements in decreasing order.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(n), where n is the length of the input array, as we iterate through it once. Space complexity is O(1), as we only use two variables to store the smallest and second smallest numbers.
