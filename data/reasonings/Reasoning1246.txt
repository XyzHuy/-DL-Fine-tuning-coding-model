1. Problem summary: Find the minimum moves to remove all elements from an array by repeatedly removing palindromic subarrays.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Dynamic Programming.
3. Step-by-step approach: Use a 2D DP table where dp[i][j] stores the minimum moves to clear arr[i...j]. Base cases are single elements (1 move). For longer subarrays, if arr[i] == arr[j], consider removing them together (dp[i+1][j-1] moves). Otherwise, split the subarray at all possible points k (dp[i][k] + dp[k+1][j] moves) and take the minimum.
4. Edge cases: Array with one element, array with two elements, all elements are distinct, all elements are the same.
5. Time and space complexity: O(n^3) time for iterating through lengths, start indices, and split points, and O(n^2) space for the DP table.
