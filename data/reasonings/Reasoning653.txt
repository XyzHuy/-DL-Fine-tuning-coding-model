1. Problem summary: Given a BST and an integer k, determine if there exist two nodes in the tree whose values sum to k.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Binary Search Tree, Depth First Search, Two-Sum
3. Step-by-step approach: Use a depth-first search (DFS) to traverse the BST. During the traversal, maintain a set of visited node values. For each node, check if the complement (k - node.val) exists in the set. If it does, return true. Otherwise, add the current node's value to the set and continue the DFS on the left and right subtrees.
4. Edge cases: Empty tree (should return false). K is smaller or larger than the possible sums. Tree with only one node.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(N) because we might need to visit all nodes. Space complexity is O(N) in the worst case (skewed tree) to store the visited nodes in the set.
