1. Problem summary: Count triplets (i, j, k) such that the XOR sum of elements from index i to j-1 equals the XOR sum of elements from index j to k.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Prefix XOR, Brute Force Optimization.
3. Step-by-step approach: Iterate through all possible start indices i and end indices k. For each pair (i, k), calculate the XOR sum of all elements from i to k. If this total XOR sum is 0, it implies there exists at least one j (where i < j <= k) such that the XOR sum from i to j-1 equals the XOR sum from j to k. The number of such valid j's for a fixed (i, k) with a total XOR sum of 0 is (k - i). Sum these counts for all valid (i, k) pairs.
4. Edge cases: The array length is at least 1. The constraints on element values do not directly introduce specific edge cases for the logic, but ensure that XOR operations are well-defined.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(n^2) due to nested loops iterating through i and k. Space complexity is O(1) as only a few variables are used.
