1. Problem summary: Count words from a given text that can be fully typed, considering a set of broken keyboard letters.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: String manipulation, iteration, set lookups.
3. Step-by-step approach: Split the text into individual words. For each word, iterate through its characters and check if any character is present in the set of broken letters. If no broken letter is found in a word, increment a counter.
4. Edge cases: Empty brokenLetters string, text with no words (though constraints prevent this), text with only one word, all letters broken.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(N) where N is the total number of characters in text, and space complexity is O(B) where B is the number of broken letters (for the set).
