1. Problem summary: Determine if string str1 can be converted to str2 through a series of character conversions, where all occurrences of a character in str1 must be converted to the same character in str2.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: String manipulation, hash map / dictionary.
3. Step-by-step approach: Check if the strings are equal, if so, return True. Check if the number of unique characters in str2 is 26, if so return false. Create a mapping from characters in str1 to characters in str2. Iterate through str1 and str2 simultaneously. If a character in str1 is already mapped to a different character than the current corresponding character in str2, return False. Otherwise, update the mapping. After checking all characters, if no conflicts were found, return True.
4. Edge cases: Empty strings (handled by the length constraint, but the str1==str2 condition effectively handles this), identical strings, strings where a character in str1 maps to multiple characters in str2, and the edge case when str2 contains all 26 lowercase letters.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(N), where N is the length of the strings. Space complexity is O(1) because the hash map will store at most 26 character mappings since only lowercase English letters are allowed.
