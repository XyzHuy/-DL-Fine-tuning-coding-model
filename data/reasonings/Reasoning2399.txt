1. Problem summary: Given a string where each lowercase English letter appears exactly twice, and an array of distances for each letter, determine if the distance between the two occurrences of each present letter matches the given distance.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: String manipulation, Array processing, Hash Map.
3. Step-by-step approach: Iterate through the string, storing the index of the first occurrence of each character. When a character's second occurrence is found, calculate the distance between its two occurrences and compare it with the corresponding value in the distance array. If they don't match for any character, return false. If all present characters satisfy the condition, return true.
4. Edge cases: The string might contain only a subset of the alphabet, or only two characters. The distance array might have zero values.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(N) where N is the length of the string s, as we iterate through it once. Space complexity is O(1) because the hash map stores at most 26 keys (for the alphabet).
