1. Problem summary: Given an array of strings, determine the number of special-equivalent groups. Two strings are special-equivalent if they can be made equal by swapping even-indexed characters and odd-indexed characters.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: String manipulation, hashing, and group identification.
3. Step-by-step approach: For each word, create a signature by separating characters at even and odd indices, sorting them independently, and combining them into a tuple. Use a dictionary to store groups of words based on their signature. The number of unique signatures corresponds to the number of special-equivalent groups.
4. Edge cases: Empty input array, single-element array, and words of length 1 or 2. The code handles these cases correctly because the sorting and grouping logic applies regardless of the input size.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(N * L * log(L)), where N is the number of words and L is the length of each word, due to sorting the even and odd characters. Space complexity is O(N * L), where N is the number of words and L is the length of each word, because in the worst case, all words have unique signatures and must be stored in the groups dictionary.
