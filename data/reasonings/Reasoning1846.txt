1. Problem summary: Given an array of positive integers, rearrange and decrease values to ensure the first element is 1 and adjacent differences are at most 1, then find the maximum possible element value.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Greedy algorithm, Sorting.
3. Step-by-step approach: Sort the array. Set the first element to 1. Iterate through the sorted array, if the current element is more than one greater than the previous, decrease it to be one greater than the previous. The last element will be the maximum possible.
4. Edge cases: Array with a single element. Array where elements already satisfy conditions.
5. Time and space complexity: Time O(N log N) due to sorting, Space O(1) or O(N) depending on sort implementation.
