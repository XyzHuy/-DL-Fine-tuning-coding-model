1. Problem summary: Given a 2D grid representing an island, calculate the perimeter of the island.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Grid traversal, basic arithmetic.
3. Step-by-step approach: Iterate through each cell in the grid. If a cell is land (1), initialize its contribution to the perimeter as 4. Check its top and left neighbors. If a neighbor is also land, subtract 2 from the perimeter (since two sides are shared). Accumulate the perimeter for each land cell.
4. Edge cases: Empty grid (though the problem states there is always one island, handling this case prevents errors), single island cell, island at the edge of the grid.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(rows * cols) due to iterating through each cell in the grid. Space complexity is O(1) as it uses constant extra space.
