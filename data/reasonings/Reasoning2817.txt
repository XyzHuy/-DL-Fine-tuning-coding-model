1. Problem summary: Find the minimum absolute difference between two numbers in an array that are at least x indices apart.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Sliding window with a sorted data structure.
3. Step-by-step approach: Iterate through the array starting from index x. For each element at index i, add the element at index i-x to a sorted list. Then, find the closest elements to nums[i] within the sorted list (which contains elements at least x indices behind the current one) and update the minimum difference.
4. Edge cases: The case where x is 0 or x is close to the array length. The sorted list might be empty or contain only one element.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(N log N) due to insertions and searches in the sorted list. Space complexity is O(N) for storing elements in the sorted list.
