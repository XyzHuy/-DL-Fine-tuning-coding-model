1. Problem summary: Determine if the sum of digits of the minimum number in an array is odd or even, returning 0 if odd and 1 if even.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Array traversal, Math, Min/Max
3. Step-by-step approach: Find the minimum element in the input array, convert the minimum element to a string, iterate through the digits of the string, convert each digit back to an integer, sum the digits, and return 0 if the sum is odd, otherwise return 1.
4. Edge cases: The array could contain duplicate minimum values. The numbers can be single or double digit based on the constraints.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(N) to find the minimum and O(log M) where M is the value of the minimum element to calculate the digit sum. Space complexity is O(1).
