1. Problem summary: Find the maximum sum of array elements that is divisible by three.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Dynamic Programming.
3. Step-by-step approach: Maintain three variables representing the maximum sum achievable with remainders 0, 1, and 2 when divided by 3. Iterate through the numbers, updating these variables by considering the current number added to previous sums. The final answer is the maximum sum with remainder 0.
4. Edge cases: Empty array (implicitly handled by initialization to 0), array where no subset sums to a multiple of 3 (results in 0).
5. Time and space complexity: O(N) time complexity as we iterate through the array once. O(1) space complexity as we use a fixed-size DP array.
