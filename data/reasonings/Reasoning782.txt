1. Problem summary: Given a binary grid, find the minimum swaps of rows and columns to transform it into a chessboard pattern.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Grid manipulation, parity check.
3. Step-by-step approach: First check if a chessboard is possible by verifying the XOR property. Then, calculate the number of swaps needed for rows and columns independently. Finally, combine the swaps and return the result.
4. Edge cases: Impossible boards due to parity issues, even vs. odd board sizes requiring different calculations, boards that are already valid chessboards (resulting in 0 moves).
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(n^2) due to iterating through the board. Space complexity is O(1) as it uses constant extra space.
