1. Problem summary: Given an array of length `length` initialized with zeros and a list of update operations, where each operation increments a range of elements by a given value, return the modified array after applying all updates.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Array manipulation, difference array technique.
3. Step-by-step approach: Initialize an array of zeros. Iterate through the updates. For each update, add the increment to the start index and subtract the increment from the index after the end index (if it exists). Finally, transform the difference array back to the original array by accumulating the values.
4. Edge cases: Empty updates list, start index equals end index, end index at the end of array length.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(n + k), where n is the length of the array and k is the number of updates. Space complexity is O(n) for the resulting array.
