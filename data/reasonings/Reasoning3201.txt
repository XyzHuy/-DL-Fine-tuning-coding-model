1. Problem summary: Find the length of the longest subsequence where the parity of the sum of adjacent elements is consistent.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Dynamic Programming, State Compression (modulo k).
3. Step-by-step approach: Use dynamic programming where the state depends on the parity of the current number and the parity of the sum of the previous two numbers. Transition involves updating the longest subsequence ending with the current parity, considering the previous valid states.
4. Edge cases: An array with only two elements always forms a valid subsequence of length 2. The modulo operation handles the parity logic.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(N*K) where K is 2, so O(N). Space complexity is O(K*K) where K is 2, so O(1).
