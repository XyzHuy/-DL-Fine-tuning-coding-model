1. Problem summary: Determine if it's possible to reach an array index with value 0 starting from a given index, by jumping forward or backward by the value at the current index.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Graph traversal (Breadth-First Search or Depth-First Search).
3. Step-by-step approach: Use a queue for BFS. Start with the given index. While the queue is not empty, dequeue an index. If it's out of bounds or already visited, skip. If the value at this index is 0, return true. Mark the current index as visited. Enqueue the two possible next indices (current index + value and current index - value). If the queue becomes empty without finding 0, return false.
4. Edge cases: Starting at an index with value 0, encountering an index that has already been visited to prevent infinite loops, and indices that lead out of array bounds.
5. Time and space complexity: O(N) time complexity because each index is visited at most once. O(N) space complexity for the visited array and the queue.
