1. Problem summary: Find the length of the longest common subsequence of two given strings.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Dynamic programming.
3. Step-by-step approach: Create a DP table where dp[i][j] stores the length of the LCS of text1[0...i-1] and text2[0...j-1]. If text1[i-1] == text2[j-1], then dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j-1] + 1. Otherwise, dp[i][j] = max(dp[i-1][j], dp[i][j-1]). The final result is dp[m][n], where m and n are the lengths of text1 and text2, respectively.
4. Edge cases: Empty strings, strings with no common subsequence. The initialization of the DP table handles these cases.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(m*n), where m and n are the lengths of the two input strings. Space complexity is also O(m*n) due to the DP table.
