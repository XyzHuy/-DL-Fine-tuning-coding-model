1. Problem summary: Count subarrays in 'nums' that follow a given 'pattern' of relative comparisons (greater than, equal to, less than).
2. Problem type / algorithm category: String matching / Sliding window (conceptual) / Brute force iteration.
3. Step-by-step approach: Iterate through all possible start indices of subarrays in 'nums' that are long enough to match the pattern. For each subarray, check if it conforms to the 'pattern' by comparing adjacent elements according to the pattern values. Increment a counter if a match is found.
4. Edge cases: The length of 'nums' is at least 2, and the length of 'pattern' is at least 1 and less than 'nums'. The values in 'nums' can be large, but only their relative order matters.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(n*m) due to nested loops, and space complexity is O(1) as only a few variables are used.
