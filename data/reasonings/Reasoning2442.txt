1. Problem summary: Given an array of positive integers, reverse each integer, add the reversed integer to the array, and count the total number of unique integers in the final array.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Set, Number manipulation.
3. Step-by-step approach: Initialize a set with all numbers from the input array. Iterate through the input array again. For each number, reverse its digits. Add the reversed number to the set. The final answer is the size of the set.
4. Edge cases: Numbers ending in zero (leading zeros after reversal are ignored by integer conversion, e.g., 10 reverses to 1). Duplicate numbers in the input array.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(N * D) where N is the number of elements and D is the maximum number of digits in an integer. Space complexity is O(N) to store the distinct integers in the set.
