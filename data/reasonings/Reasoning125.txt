1. Problem summary: Determine if a given string is a palindrome after converting it to lowercase and removing non-alphanumeric characters.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: String manipulation, palindrome checking.
3. Step-by-step approach: Convert the string to lowercase, filter out non-alphanumeric characters, create a cleaned string, and compare the cleaned string to its reverse.
4. Edge cases: Empty string, strings with only non-alphanumeric characters, strings that are already palindromes, strings that are not palindromes.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(n) due to iterating through the string and string slicing. Space complexity is O(n) due to creating the filtered string.
