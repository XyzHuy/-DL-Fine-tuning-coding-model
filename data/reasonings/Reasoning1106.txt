1. Problem summary: Evaluate a boolean expression string involving 't', 'f', '!', '&', and '|' operators.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Stack-based expression evaluation.
3. Step-by-step approach: Iterate through the expression, pushing characters onto a stack. When encountering a closing parenthesis, evaluate the subexpression by popping elements from the stack until the operator is found. Apply the operator (!, &, or |) to the operands and push the result back onto the stack.
4. Edge cases: Empty expression (though the problem statement guarantees a valid expression), nested expressions, single 't' or 'f' as input.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(n), where n is the length of the expression, due to iterating through the expression once. Space complexity is also O(n) in the worst case, as the stack can potentially store all characters of the expression.
