1. Problem summary: Determine if any permutation of string s1 can break any permutation of string s2, or vice versa, where breaking means each character in the first string is alphabetically greater than or equal to the corresponding character in the second string at the same index.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: String manipulation, sorting, greedy approach.
3. Step-by-step approach: Sort both input strings alphabetically. Then, check if the sorted s1 can break the sorted s2 by comparing characters at each index. Separately, check if the sorted s2 can break the sorted s1. Return true if either of these checks is successful.
4. Edge cases: Strings of length 1, strings with all identical characters. The constraints guarantee non-empty strings of equal length.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is dominated by sorting, O(N log N), where N is the length of the strings. Space complexity is O(N) or O(log N) depending on the sorting algorithm used (for storing the sorted strings or recursion stack).
