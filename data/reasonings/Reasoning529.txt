1. Problem summary: Given a Minesweeper board and a click position, update the board based on the game rules, revealing mines or empty squares and adjacent mine counts.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Depth-First Search (DFS), Array Manipulation.
3. Step-by-step approach: If the click reveals a mine, change it to 'X' and return. Otherwise, use DFS to recursively reveal adjacent empty squares. Count adjacent mines for each revealed square.
4. Edge cases: Clicking on a mine, clicking on a revealed square (should not happen based on the problem description), boundary checks for DFS.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(M*N) in the worst case where M and N are board dimensions. Space complexity is O(M*N) due to the call stack in the worst case of recursive calls.
