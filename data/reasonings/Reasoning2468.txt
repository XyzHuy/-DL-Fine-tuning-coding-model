1. Problem summary: Split a message into the minimum number of parts such that each part, when appended with a suffix indicating its index and total parts, does not exceed a given limit, and the original message can be reconstructed.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Binary Search on the number of parts, String manipulation.
3. Step-by-step approach: First, use binary search to find the minimum number of parts (k) required. For a given k, check if it's possible to split by calculating the available space for message characters in each part after accounting for the suffix length. If k parts are feasible, then construct the parts by iterating from 1 to k, determining the suffix and remaining character space for each part, and filling it with message characters.
4. Edge cases: A limit too small to even fit the smallest possible suffix. The message length being very large or very small. The number of digits in the part index or total parts impacting suffix length.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(N log N) where N is the message length, due to binary search (log N iterations) and within each check, iterating up to N times for suffix length calculation and within the construction phase, iterating N times. Space complexity is O(N) for storing the resulting parts.
