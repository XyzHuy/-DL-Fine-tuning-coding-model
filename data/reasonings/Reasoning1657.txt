1. Problem summary: Determine if two strings can be made identical by swapping characters and by swapping character frequencies.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: String manipulation, Frequency analysis, Sorting.
3. Step-by-step approach: Check if lengths are equal, check if character sets are equal, and check if sorted character frequencies are equal.
4. Edge cases: Strings of different lengths, strings with different character sets.
5. Time and space complexity: Time O(N log N) due to sorting, Space O(K) where K is the alphabet size (26).
