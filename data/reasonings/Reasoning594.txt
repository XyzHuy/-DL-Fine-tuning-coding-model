1. Problem summary: Find the length of the longest harmonious subsequence (max - min = 1) in an integer array.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Hash map / Counter, array traversal.
3. Step-by-step approach: Count the occurrences of each number, then iterate through the counts and check if the number + 1 exists. If it does, update the max length with the sum of the counts of the number and number + 1.
4. Edge cases: Empty array, array with no harmonious subsequence.
5. Time and space complexity: Time: O(n), Space: O(n)
