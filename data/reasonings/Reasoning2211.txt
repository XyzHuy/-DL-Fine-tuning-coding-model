1. Problem summary: Calculate total collisions between cars moving left, right, or stationary on a road, considering collisions with moving and stationary cars.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Two Pointers, Simulation.
3. Step-by-step approach: Ignore leading 'L' cars and trailing 'R' cars as they won't collide. Iterate through the remaining cars; each non-'S' car in this middle section will eventually collide.
4. Edge cases: All cars moving in the same direction ('LLLL', 'RRRR'), no cars (''), all cars stationary ('SSSS').
5. Time and space complexity: O(N) time complexity due to single pass, O(N) space complexity for list conversion (or O(1) if modifying in-place).
