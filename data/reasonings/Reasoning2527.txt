1. Problem summary: Calculate the XOR sum of effective values for all possible triplets (i, j, k) from an array, where effective value is (nums[i] | nums[j]) & nums[k].
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Bitwise operations, brute force observation, optimization.
3. Step-by-step approach: The problem asks for the XOR sum of (nums[i] | nums[j]) & nums[k] for all i, j, k. Consider a single bit position. For this bit to be 1 in the final XOR sum, it must appear an odd number of times in the effective values of all triplets. If for a specific bit position, at least one number in `nums` has that bit set to 1, then we can construct triplets where `nums[k]` has that bit set. Then, by choosing `nums[i]` and `nums[j]` appropriately (either can have the bit set), the `(nums[i] | nums[j]) & nums[k]` will have that bit set. If any number in `nums` has a bit set, we can ensure that this bit contributes to the final XOR sum. Thus, we only need to XOR all the numbers in `nums` together.
4. Edge cases: The array can have duplicate numbers. The constraints guarantee at least one element.
5. Time and space complexity: Time O(N), Space O(1).
