1. Problem summary: Find the minimum steps to reach the bottom-right corner from the top-left corner in a grid, with the ability to eliminate at most k obstacles.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Breadth-First Search (BFS) on a state space.
3. Step-by-step approach: Perform BFS starting from (0,0) with initial k obstacles remaining. Each state in the BFS queue is (row, col, steps, remaining_k). Explore neighbors, updating remaining_k if an obstacle is encountered. Mark visited states as (row, col, remaining_k) to avoid cycles. Return steps when the destination is reached.
4. Edge cases: An empty grid, a 1x1 grid, the start and end points being obstacles (though constraints state they are 0), and cases where the destination is unreachable.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(m * n * k) due to states (row, col, k). Space complexity is O(m * n * k) for the visited set and queue.
