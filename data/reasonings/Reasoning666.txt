1. Problem summary: Given an array of three-digit integers representing a binary tree, calculate the sum of all paths from the root to the leaves.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Tree traversal, Depth-First Search (DFS).
3. Step-by-step approach: Represent the tree using a dictionary. Perform a DFS traversal of the tree, keeping track of the path sum. If a node is a leaf, add the path sum to the total sum.
4. Edge cases: Empty input array. Single node tree.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(N), where N is the number of nodes in the tree. Space complexity is O(N) for the dictionary and the stack in the worst case.
