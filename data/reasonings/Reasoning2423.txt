1. Problem summary: Determine if removing exactly one character from a string can make the frequencies of all remaining characters equal.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: String manipulation, frequency counting, brute force with optimization.
3. Step-by-step approach: Count initial frequencies. Iterate through each unique character. For each character, simulate its removal by decrementing its count and checking if all remaining character counts are equal.
4. Edge cases: String with only two characters, string where all characters are the same, string where removing one character results in an empty frequency set.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(N*C) where N is word length and C is alphabet size (26), due to iterating through unique characters and checking frequencies. Space complexity is O(C) for the frequency counter.
