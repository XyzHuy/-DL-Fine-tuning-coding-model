1. Problem summary: Find the maximum possible value for an element at a given index in an array of length n, such that adjacent elements differ by at most 1, all elements are positive, and the total sum does not exceed maxSum.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Binary Search on Answer (Value) and Greedy construction.
3. Step-by-step approach: Perform binary search on the possible value of nums[index]. For a given candidate value `mid`, check if it's possible to construct an array where nums[index] = `mid` without exceeding `maxSum`. This check involves calculating the minimum possible sum of the array with `mid` at `index` using a greedy approach (values decrease by 1 as we move away from `index` until they reach 1). Adjust the binary search range based on the feasibility.
4. Edge cases: The constraints on n, index, and maxSum are large, requiring efficient sum calculation. The `mid` value could be as small as 1. The array elements must be positive integers.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(log(maxSum) * n) if the sum calculation is O(n), but O(log(maxSum)) with optimized sum calculation (arithmetic progression). Space complexity is O(1).
