1. Problem summary: Count the number of valid words in a given sentence string. A valid word adheres to specific rules regarding letters, hyphens, and punctuation.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: String processing, pattern matching, validation.
3. Step-by-step approach: Split the sentence into tokens by spaces. For each token, check if it meets the criteria for a valid word: no digits, at most one hyphen surrounded by letters, and at most one punctuation mark at the very end. Count the tokens that satisfy all conditions.
4. Edge cases: Tokens consisting only of punctuation, tokens with hyphens at the beginning or end, tokens with multiple hyphens or punctuation, tokens with digits, empty tokens (handled by split).
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(N*L) where N is the number of tokens and L is the average length of a token, as each token is iterated over. Space complexity is O(N*L) for storing tokens, or O(N) if considering only the extra space used for counts.
