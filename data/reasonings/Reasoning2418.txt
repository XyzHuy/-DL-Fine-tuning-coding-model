1. Problem summary: Rearrange an array of names based on corresponding distinct heights in descending order.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Sorting, Data Structure Manipulation.
3. Step-by-step approach: Pair each name with its height, sort these pairs based on height in descending order, and then extract the names from the sorted pairs.
4. Edge cases: The problem guarantees distinct heights, so no special handling for duplicate heights is needed. The input arrays are non-empty.
5. Time and space complexity: O(N log N) time for sorting and O(N) space for storing the paired data, where N is the number of people.
