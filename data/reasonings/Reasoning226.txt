1. Problem summary: Given the root of a binary tree, invert the tree such that the left and right subtrees of each node are swapped.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Tree traversal, recursion.
3. Step-by-step approach: Recursively traverse the tree. At each node, swap its left and right children. Then, recursively invert the left subtree and the right subtree.
4. Edge cases: Empty tree (root is None).
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the tree. Space complexity is O(h), where h is the height of the tree, due to the recursion stack. In the worst case (skewed tree), h = n, so the space complexity is O(n). In the best case (balanced tree), h = log n, so the space complexity is O(log n).
