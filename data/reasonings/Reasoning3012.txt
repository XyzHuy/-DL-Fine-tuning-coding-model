1. Problem summary: Minimize the length of an array of positive integers by repeatedly replacing two elements `a` and `b` with `a % b`, and removing `a` and `b`.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Number theory, greatest common divisor (GCD) properties.
3. Step-by-step approach: Find the minimum element. If all elements are divisible by the minimum, repeatedly take the minimum modulo itself (which is 0) until only instances of the minimum remain, and then pair them up. If any element is not divisible by the minimum, the GCD of all elements can be reduced to 1, allowing the array to be reduced to a single element.
4. Edge cases: All elements are the same, or all elements are multiples of the smallest element. An array with a single element.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(N) due to finding the minimum and counting occurrences. Space complexity is O(1) as only a few variables are used.
