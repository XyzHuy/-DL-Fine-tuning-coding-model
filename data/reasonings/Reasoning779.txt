1. Problem summary: Find the kth symbol in the nth row of a grammar-generated table where each row is generated by replacing 0 with 01 and 1 with 10 from the previous row, starting with 0 in the first row.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Recursion / Binary Tree
3. Step-by-step approach: Use recursion. If n is 1, return 0. Otherwise, determine if k is in the first or second half of the current row. If it's in the first half, recursively call the function with n-1 and k. If it's in the second half, recursively call the function with n-1 and k minus the length of the previous row, then return the complement (1-result) of the result.
4. Edge cases: n = 1 should return 0.
5. Time and space complexity: O(n) time complexity because the recursion depth is n. O(n) space complexity due to the recursive call stack.
