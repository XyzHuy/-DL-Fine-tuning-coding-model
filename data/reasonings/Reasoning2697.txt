1. Problem summary: Convert a given string into a palindrome with the minimum number of character replacements, prioritizing the lexicographically smallest result.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: String manipulation, Two Pointers.
3. Step-by-step approach: Use two pointers, one starting from the beginning and the other from the end of the string. Compare characters at these pointers. If they differ, replace the character at the right pointer with the character at the left pointer if the left character is smaller, ensuring the lexicographically smallest palindrome. Then move both pointers inwards.
4. Edge cases: Strings of length 1 (already a palindrome), strings that are already palindromes, strings with all same characters.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(n) because we iterate through half of the string. Space complexity is O(n) for storing the modified string as a list.
