1. Problem summary: Count how many strings from a given list `patterns` are present as substrings within another string `word`.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: String manipulation, substring search.
3. Step-by-step approach: Initialize a counter to zero. Iterate through each string in the `patterns` list. For each pattern string, check if it exists as a substring within the `word` string. If it does, increment the counter. Finally, return the total count.
4. Edge cases: Empty `patterns` list (should return 0), `patterns` strings being empty (will be found in any `word`), `word` being empty (no non-empty pattern will be found).
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(N * M * L), where N is the number of patterns, M is the length of `word`, and L is the average length of a pattern. Space complexity is O(1) (excluding input storage).
