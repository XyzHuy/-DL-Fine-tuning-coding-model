1. Problem summary: The task is to remove the middle node from a singly linked list and return the head of the modified list. The middle node is defined as the ⌊n / 2⌋th node (0-indexed) where n is the list's size.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Linked List Manipulation, Two Pointers.
3. Step-by-step approach: Use two pointers, 'slow' and 'fast'. 'fast' moves twice as fast as 'slow'. When 'fast' reaches the end, 'slow' will be at the middle node. Keep track of the node 'prev' just before 'slow' to update its 'next' pointer to skip the middle node.
4. Edge cases: The list might have only one node or be empty. If the list has only one node, it's the middle node and should be removed, resulting in an empty list.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(n) because we traverse the list once. Space complexity is O(1) as we only use a few extra variables.
