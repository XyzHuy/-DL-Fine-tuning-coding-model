1. Problem summary: The goal is to find the minimum number of swaps to group all 1s together in a binary circular array.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Sliding window, array manipulation.
3. Step-by-step approach: Count the total number of ones. Then, use a sliding window of the size equal to the total number of ones to find the window with the maximum number of ones. The minimum swaps needed is the total number of ones minus the maximum number of ones in any window. To handle circularity, double the array and slide the window across the doubled array.
4. Edge cases: Cases where there are no 1s or all elements are 1s require zero swaps.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(N) due to the single pass through the array and the sliding window. Space complexity is O(N) for creating the doubled array.
