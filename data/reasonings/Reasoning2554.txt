1. Problem summary: Select the maximum count of unique integers within the range [1, n] that are not in the banned list and whose sum does not exceed maxSum.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Greedy approach, Set usage.
3. Step-by-step approach: Convert the banned list into a set for efficient lookups. Iterate through numbers from 1 to n. If a number is not banned and adding it to the current sum does not exceed maxSum, add it and increment the count. Stop when adding the current number would exceed maxSum.
4. Edge cases: If n is small and maxSum is large, all non-banned numbers up to n might be chosen. If many numbers are banned, or maxSum is very small, it might be impossible to choose any numbers. If banned contains all numbers in the range [1, n].
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(n + b) where b is the length of banned, due to set creation and iteration up to n. Space complexity is O(b) for storing the banned set.
