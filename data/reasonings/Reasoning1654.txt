1. Problem summary: Find the minimum jumps from 0 to reach position x, with allowed forward jumps of 'a', backward jumps of 'b', forbidden positions, and a constraint against consecutive backward jumps.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Breadth-First Search (BFS) on a state space.
3. Step-by-step approach: Use BFS to explore reachable positions. The state includes the current position and the direction of the last jump to prevent consecutive backward moves. Maintain a set of visited states to avoid cycles and redundant computations. Start from (0, None, 0) and expand layer by layer.
4. Edge cases: The bug cannot jump to negative positions, forbidden positions, or jump backward twice in a row. If x is unreachable, return -1. The maximum position to explore needs to be estimated.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(max_position * 2) due to exploring up to a certain max position with two possible previous jump directions. Space complexity is O(max_position * 2) for the visited set and the queue.
