1. Problem summary: Given a string `s` containing digits and '*', determine the number of ways to decode it, where '*' can represent any digit from 1 to 9. The result should be modulo 10^9 + 7.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Dynamic Programming.
3. Step-by-step approach: Use dynamic programming to build up the number of ways to decode the string up to each index. Define `ways_one(c)` to calculate the number of ways to decode a single character and `ways_two(c1, c2)` to calculate the number of ways to decode two characters. Iterate through the string, updating the number of ways based on the previous one and two characters.
4. Edge cases: Handle the cases where the string is empty or starts with '0', and the different combinations of '*' characters.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(n), where n is the length of the string, due to the single loop. Space complexity is O(1), as we only store the previous two values in the DP table.
