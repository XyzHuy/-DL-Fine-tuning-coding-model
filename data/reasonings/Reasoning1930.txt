1. Problem summary: Count unique palindromic subsequences of length three from a given string.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: String manipulation, subsequences, set operations.
3. Step-by-step approach: Find the first and last index for each unique character. Iterate through each character, considering it as the outer character of a length-3 palindrome. Then, iterate through all characters present between its first and last occurrence to form the middle character of the palindrome. Store these unique palindromes in a set.
4. Edge cases: Strings shorter than 3 characters (though constraints prevent this), strings with only one unique character, strings where a character's first and last occurrence are adjacent.
5. Time and space complexity: Time O(26 * N), Space O(26^2) or O(26*N) depending on set implementation details.
