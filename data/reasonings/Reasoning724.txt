1. Problem summary: Find the pivot index in an array where the sum of elements to the left equals the sum of elements to the right.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Array manipulation, prefix sum.
3. Step-by-step approach: Calculate the total sum of the array. Iterate through the array, maintaining a running left sum. For each index, check if the left sum equals the right sum (total sum - left sum - current element). If they are equal, return the index. If no such index is found, return -1.
4. Edge cases: Empty array (although the problem states the length will be at least 1), array with only one element, pivot index at the beginning or end of the array.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(n) due to the single iteration through the array. Space complexity is O(1) as we only use a few constant space variables.
