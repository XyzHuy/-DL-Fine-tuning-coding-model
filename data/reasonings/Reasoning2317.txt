1. Problem summary: Find the maximum possible bitwise XOR sum of array elements after applying a specific bitwise operation any number of times.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Bit manipulation, Greedy.
3. Step-by-step approach: The operation `nums[i] = nums[i] AND (nums[i] XOR x)` effectively allows us to unset any bit in `nums[i]` that is also set in `x`. By choosing `x` appropriately, we can turn any bit in an element `nums[i]` to 0. The goal is to maximize the XOR sum. If a bit is present in at least one number, we can potentially keep it. Thus, the maximum XOR sum is achieved by considering all bits that are set in any of the numbers. This is equivalent to the bitwise OR of all numbers.
4. Edge cases: The array can be empty (though constraints say 1 <= nums.length). All numbers can be 0. All numbers can be identical.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(N) where N is the number of elements in nums, due to a single pass. Space complexity is O(1) as we only use a single variable to store the result.
