1. Problem summary: Determine the number of distinct phone numbers of length n that can be dialed using a knight's movement on a phone keypad.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Dynamic Programming.
3. Step-by-step approach: Use dynamic programming where dp[i] represents the number of ways to reach digit i. Iterate from length 1 to n, updating dp array based on knight's possible moves. Modulo by 10^9 + 7 at each step to avoid overflow.
4. Edge cases: n = 1, large values of n requiring modulo operation.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(n) because of the loop, and O(1) space complexity (specifically, O(10)) since the dp array has a fixed size of 10, independent of n.
