1. Problem summary: Group strings that belong to the same shifting sequence, where a shifting sequence is defined by repeatedly shifting each letter to the next or previous letter in the alphabet (wrapping around).
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Hashing, string manipulation.
3. Step-by-step approach: Define a hash function that maps each string to a unique key based on the differences between consecutive characters. Group the strings based on this hash key.
4. Edge cases: Empty string, single-character string, strings with same length but different characters.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(N * L) where N is the number of strings and L is the maximum length of a string. Space complexity is O(N * L) in the worst case to store the hash map and the grouped strings.
