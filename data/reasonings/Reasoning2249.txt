1. Problem summary: Count the total number of unique integer coordinate points that fall within or on the boundary of at least one given circle.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Brute Force / Geometry / Set Data Structure.
3. Step-by-step approach: Determine the bounding box for all possible lattice points. Iterate through each lattice point within this bounding box and check if it lies inside any of the given circles using the distance formula. Store unique points in a set and return its size.
4. Edge cases: Circles with radius 0 (although constraints say ri >= 1), circles that are completely outside the grid boundaries or too far from origin to contain any lattice points.
5. Time and space complexity: O(N * W * H) time where N is the number of circles, W and H are the width and height of the bounding box, and O(P) space where P is the number of unique lattice points found.
