1. Problem summary: Check if for each index i, the digit i appears num[i] times in the input string.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Counting occurrences, String manipulation.
3. Step-by-step approach: Count the frequency of each digit 0-9 in the input string. Then, iterate through the string's indices. For each index i, compare the actual count of digit i with the value at num[i]. If they don't match for any index, return false. If all indices match, return true.
4. Edge cases: The length of the string is small (1 to 10). All characters are digits.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(N) because we iterate through the string twice (once for counting, once for checking). Space complexity is O(1) as we only use a fixed-size array for counts.
