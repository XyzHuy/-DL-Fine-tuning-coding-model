1. Problem summary: Construct a target array using stack operations (Push, Pop) from a stream of integers [1, n].
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Array manipulation, simulation, greedy.
3. Step-by-step approach: Iterate through numbers from 1 up to n. For each target number, push it. If the current stream number is not the target number, push and then pop until the stream number matches the target number.
4. Edge cases: Target array can be empty (though constraints say length >= 1), n can be small or large, target values are strictly increasing.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(n) because we iterate up to n and perform constant operations per stream number. Space complexity is O(k) where k is the length of the output operations list.
