1. Problem summary: Determine if a string can become a palindrome after deleting at most one character.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: String manipulation / Two Pointers / Palindrome.
3. Step-by-step approach: Use two pointers to iterate from the start and end of the string. If a mismatch is found, check if the string becomes a palindrome after removing either the left or right character. If no mismatch is found, the string is already a palindrome.
4. Edge cases: Empty string, single character string, already a palindrome string.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(n) because in the worst case we iterate through the string twice. Space complexity is O(1) because we are using constant extra space.
