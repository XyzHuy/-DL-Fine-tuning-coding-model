1. Problem summary: Iterate through a binary array, and for each prefix, determine if the decimal value of the binary number it represents is divisible by 5.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Array, Math, Modular Arithmetic.
3. Step-by-step approach: Iterate through the input array while maintaining the current number's value. To form the next number, shift the current value left by one bit (multiply by 2) and add the new bit. To prevent overflow with large inputs, perform all calculations modulo 5, since only the remainder is needed to check divisibility. Append true to the result if the current value modulo 5 is zero, otherwise append false.
4. Edge cases: The main edge case is that the number represented by a prefix can become very large, exceeding standard integer limits. The use of the modulo operator at each step neatly avoids this issue.
5. Time and space complexity: The time complexity is O(N) as it involves a single pass through the array. The space complexity is O(N) to store the resulting boolean array.
