1. Problem summary: Given a node's label in a zigzag labeled binary tree, find the path from the root to that node.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Tree traversal, bit manipulation.
3. Step-by-step approach: Start from the target label and work upwards towards the root. In each step, determine the level of the current node. Use the level to calculate the value of the parent node using the formula label = (3 * (1 << level) - 1 - label) // 2. Append the current node to the path and update the current node to its parent. Finally, reverse the path to get the correct order from root to target.
4. Edge cases: The input label is always a valid node label. Consider the case when the input label is 1, which is the root node.
5. Time and space complexity: The time complexity is O(logN), where N is the input label, because the while loop iterates from the target node to the root, which takes logarithmic time. The space complexity is O(logN) to store the path from the root to the target node.
