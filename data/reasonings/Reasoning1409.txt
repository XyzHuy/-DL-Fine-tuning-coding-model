1. Problem summary: Process queries by finding an element's position in a permutation, recording the position, and then moving the element to the front of the permutation.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Simulation, List manipulation.
3. Step-by-step approach: Initialize a permutation list from 1 to m. For each query, find its index in the current permutation, store the index as the result, and then move the queried element to the beginning of the permutation.
4. Edge cases: The problem constraints guarantee that queries are valid (within 1 to m) and that m is at least 1.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(N*M) where N is the number of queries and M is the initial size of the permutation, due to searching and list manipulation. Space complexity is O(M) for storing the permutation and results.
