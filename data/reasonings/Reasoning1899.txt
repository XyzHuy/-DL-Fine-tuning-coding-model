1. Problem summary: Determine if a target triplet [x, y, z] can be formed by merging any number of given triplets, where merging involves taking element-wise maximums.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Greedy algorithm, Maximum value tracking.
3. Step-by-step approach: Iterate through each triplet and check if its elements are less than or equal to the corresponding target elements. If so, update the maximum achievable values for each position in the target triplet. Finally, compare the maximum achievable values with the target triplet.
4. Edge cases: Target triplet values might not be present in any individual triplet, or no combination of triplets can form the target.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(N) where N is the number of triplets, and space complexity is O(1) as we only store a fixed-size array for maximum values.
