1. Problem summary: Given a string with alternating letters and digits, replace each digit with the result of a shift operation on the preceding character and the digit's integer value.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: String manipulation, Iteration.
3. Step-by-step approach: Iterate through the string. If an index is odd (contains a digit), apply the shift operation using the character at the previous even index and the integer value of the current digit, appending the result. If the index is even (contains a letter), append the letter directly.
4. Edge cases: The input string length is at least 1. The shift operation is guaranteed not to exceed 'z'. The first character is always a letter.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(N) where N is the length of the string, as we iterate through it once. Space complexity is O(N) to store the result string.
