1. Problem summary: Given n lights and 4 buttons that flip different sets of lights, find the number of distinct light configurations possible after pressing any combination of buttons exactly 'presses' times.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Combinatorics, Pattern Recognition, State Space Reduction.
3. Step-by-step approach: Reduce the problem by observing that the light states repeat after every 3 lights. Thus, the number of lights `n` is capped at 3. Enumerate all possible states for the reduced number of lights based on the number of button presses. Consider the base cases when presses is 0, n is 1, 2, or 3.
4. Edge cases: n = 0 or presses = 0, large values of n can be reduced to 3, different values of presses influence the final distinct light states.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(1) since we only consider a limited number of cases. Space complexity is O(1) as we only use constant space.
