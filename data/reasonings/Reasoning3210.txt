1. Problem summary: Encrypt a string by replacing each character with the kth character after it, cyclically.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: String manipulation, modular arithmetic.
3. Step-by-step approach: Iterate through the input string. For each character at index i, calculate the new index by adding k and taking the result modulo the string length. Append the character at this new index to the result. Join the characters to form the encrypted string.
4. Edge cases: String length of 1, k being a multiple of string length.
5. Time and space complexity: Time O(n), Space O(n) where n is the length of the string s.
