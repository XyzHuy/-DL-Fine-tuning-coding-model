1. Problem summary: Given a 2D board with 'X' and 'O', capture 'O' regions surrounded by 'X'. Surrounded regions are replaced with 'X'. 'O's connected to the border are not captured.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Graph traversal / Depth-First Search (DFS).
3. Step-by-step approach: First, find 'O's connected to the border and mark them as 'T'. Then, iterate through the board and flip remaining 'O's to 'X's. Finally, revert 'T's back to 'O's.
4. Edge cases: Empty board, board with no 'O's, board with only 'X's.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(m*n) where m is the number of rows and n is the number of columns. Space complexity is O(m*n) in the worst case due to the recursion depth of the DFS.
