1. Problem summary: Interpret a given command string according to specific rules: "G" becomes "G", "()" becomes "o", and "(al)" becomes "al". Concatenate the interpreted parts to form the final string.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: String manipulation, pattern replacement.
3. Step-by-step approach: Iterate through the command string. If a 'G' is encountered, append 'G' to the result. If '()' is encountered, append 'o'. If '(al)' is encountered, append 'al'. A simpler approach is to directly use string replacement functions.
4. Edge cases: The command string can be short (length 1) or up to 100. It is guaranteed to consist only of "G", "()", and "(al)". Empty string is not possible due to constraints.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(N) due to string replacement operations where N is the length of the command. Space complexity is O(N) to store the resulting string.
