1. Problem summary: The problem asks to determine if any two strings in a given list differ by exactly one character at the same position.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: String manipulation and hashing/set usage.
3. Step-by-step approach: For each string, iterate through each character position. At each position, create a "generic form" of the string by replacing the character with a wildcard (e.g., '*'). Check if this generic form has been seen before. If yes, it implies a pair of strings differs by one character at that position. If not, add the generic form to a set of seen forms.
4. Edge cases: An empty dictionary or a dictionary with only one string would not have any pairs to compare, thus returning false. The constraints guarantee unique strings of equal length.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(N * M) where N is the number of strings and M is the length of each string. Space complexity is O(N * M) to store the generic forms in the set.
