1. Problem summary: Determine if string `start` can be transformed to `result` by swapping "XL" to "LX" and "RX" to "XR".
2. Problem type / algorithm category: String manipulation, two pointers.
3. Step-by-step approach: First, verify the order of 'L' and 'R' is same after removing 'X'. Then, for 'L', check if its index in `start` is always greater than or equal to its index in `result`. For 'R', check if its index in `start` is always less than or equal to its index in `result`.
4. Edge cases: Empty strings, strings with no 'L' or 'R', unequal counts of 'L' or 'R' after removing 'X'.
5. Time and space complexity: Time: O(N), where N is the length of the string. Space: O(N) in worst case due to storing indices of 'L' and 'R', although it could be considered O(1) due to constant number of lists.
