1. Problem summary: Given an array representing chalk needed by students and an initial amount of chalk, find which student will first run out of chalk and need to replace it, given students cycle through problems.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Greedy, Modular Arithmetic.
3. Step-by-step approach: Calculate the sum of chalk needed for one full cycle. Use the modulo operator with this sum and the initial chalk to find the effective remaining chalk after completing as many full cycles as possible. Then, simulate the students' turns with this reduced chalk amount until a student cannot afford their chalk.
4. Edge cases: The initial chalk 'k' could be very large, necessitating the use of modulo arithmetic. The chalk array could be empty or contain only one student. The chalk needed by a student could be larger than 'k' from the start.
5. Time and space complexity: O(N) time complexity due to a single pass for sum and a single pass for simulation. O(1) space complexity as only a few variables are used.
