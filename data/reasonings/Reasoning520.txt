1. Problem summary: Determine if capital usage in a given word is valid according to the problem's rules.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: String manipulation, conditional checks.
3. Step-by-step approach: Check if the word is all uppercase, all lowercase, or only the first letter is uppercase and the rest are lowercase. Return true if any of these conditions are met, false otherwise.
4. Edge cases: Empty string (though constraints specify length >= 1), single-character strings.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(n) due to string methods. Space complexity is O(1).
