1. Problem summary: Determine if an array of 2*n integers can be partitioned into n pairs where each pair consists of two equal elements.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Frequency counting, Array manipulation.
3. Step-by-step approach: Count the occurrences of each number. If every number appears an even number of times, then pairs can be formed; otherwise, they cannot.
4. Edge cases: The problem guarantees that the array length is always 2*n, so an empty or odd-length array is not a concern. All numbers are within a specific range.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(n) for counting frequencies and checking counts. Space complexity is O(k) where k is the number of distinct elements, which is at most O(n) in the worst case.
