1. Problem summary: Split a given integer into the maximum possible count of unique positive even integers that sum up to it.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Greedy algorithm.
3. Step-by-step approach: Start with the smallest unique positive even integer (2) and keep adding subsequent even integers (4, 6, ...) as long as the remaining sum is greater than or equal to the current even integer. If a remainder exists after the loop, add it to the last added even integer to ensure uniqueness and maintain the sum.
4. Edge cases: The input `finalSum` is odd, in which case no valid split into even integers is possible.
5. Time and space complexity: O(sqrt(finalSum)) time complexity due to the loop adding consecutive even numbers, and O(sqrt(finalSum)) space complexity to store the resulting list of even numbers.
