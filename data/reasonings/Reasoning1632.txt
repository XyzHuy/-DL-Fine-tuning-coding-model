1. Problem summary: Assign a rank to each element in a matrix based on its value and position, such that elements in the same row or column maintain relative order, and ranks are minimized.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Graph Theory (Union-Find), Sorting, Greedy.
3. Step-by-step approach: Group elements by their values. For each value, use Union-Find to connect elements that share a row or column. Then, process these connected components, assigning ranks based on the maximum rank of elements already processed in their respective rows and columns, and update these maximums.
4. Edge cases: Matrices with all same values; Matrices with single row or single column; Matrices with negative numbers.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is dominated by sorting unique values and Union-Find operations, roughly O(M*N*log(M*N)). Space complexity is O(M*N) for storing value-position mappings, ranks, and Union-Find structure.
