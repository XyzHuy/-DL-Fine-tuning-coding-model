1. Problem summary: Given a string and an array of shifts, shift the first i+1 characters of the string by shifts[i] wrapping around the alphabet.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: String manipulation, prefix sum/cumulative sum.
3. Step-by-step approach: Calculate the cumulative shifts from right to left. Then, iterate through the string, applying the appropriate cumulative shift to each character and updating the cumulative shift for the next character.
4. Edge cases: Large shift values require modulo operation to stay within alphabet range (0-25).
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(n) due to iterating through the string and shifts array. Space complexity is O(n) due to storing the shifted characters in a list.
