1. Problem summary: The goal is to find the minimum number of operations to make all elements in an array greater than or equal to a given value k, where an operation consists of removing the smallest element.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Counting, Iteration.
3. Step-by-step approach: Iterate through the array and count how many elements are strictly less than k. Each such element must be removed, and since we always remove the smallest, any element less than k will eventually be removed before any element greater than or equal to k.
4. Edge cases: If all elements are already greater than or equal to k, the result is 0. The constraints guarantee at least one element is >= k.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(n) where n is the length of nums, as we iterate through it once. Space complexity is O(1) as we only use a counter.
