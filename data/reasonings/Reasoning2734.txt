1. Problem summary: Transform a string of lowercase English letters by replacing a chosen substring with its preceding alphabetic characters (a becomes z) to achieve the lexicographically smallest result.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: String manipulation, greedy algorithm.
3. Step-by-step approach: Find the first character that is not 'a'. Then, find the contiguous block of characters starting from this non-'a' character until the next 'a' or the end of the string. Decrement each character in this block by one (wrapping 'a' to 'z'). If the entire string is 'a's, change the last 'a' to 'z'.
4. Edge cases: The string consists entirely of 'a's. The string contains only one character.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(N) where N is the length of the string, as we iterate through the string at most twice. Space complexity is O(N) to store the resulting string.
