1. Problem summary: Determine if n flowers can be planted in a flowerbed (array of 0s and 1s) such that no two flowers are adjacent.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Array traversal, greedy algorithm.
3. Step-by-step approach: Iterate through the flowerbed array. At each position, check if it's empty (0). If it is, also check if the adjacent positions are empty or out of bounds. If both adjacent positions are empty or out of bounds, plant a flower (set the current position to 1) and increment the count of planted flowers. If the count reaches n, return True. If the loop finishes without planting n flowers, return False.
4. Edge cases: Empty flowerbed, n is zero, flowerbed with only one plot. Consider the boundaries of the flowerbed when checking adjacent plots.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(m), where m is the length of the flowerbed. Space complexity is O(1) as we modify the input array in place and use a constant amount of extra space.
