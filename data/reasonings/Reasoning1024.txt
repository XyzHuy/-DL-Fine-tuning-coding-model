1. Problem summary: Find the minimum number of video clips needed to form a continuous segment covering the entire interval from 0 to a specified time.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: This is a classic interval covering problem, best solved with a greedy algorithm.
3. Step-by-step approach: The strategy is to extend the covered range as much as possible at each step. Start with a covered range ending at 0. In each iteration, find all clips that start within the currently covered range and pick the one that extends farthest. Update the end of the covered range to this new farthest point and increment the clip count. Repeat this process until the entire [0, time] interval is covered.
4. Edge cases: If at any point we cannot extend our coverage further (meaning there is a gap in time that no available clip can cover), the task is impossible. Also, if the initial time 0 is not covered by any clip, it's impossible. The final covered range must be at least up to 'time'.
5. Time and space complexity: The time complexity is dominated by the initial sort, making it O(N log N), where N is the number of clips. The space complexity is O(log N) or O(N) for the sorting algorithm's auxiliary space.
