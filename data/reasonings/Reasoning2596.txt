1. Problem summary: Given an n x n grid representing a knight's path, determine if it's a valid traversal visiting each cell exactly once, starting from 0 at (0,0).
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Graph traversal / simulation, Adjacency checking.
3. Step-by-step approach: Verify the start is 0 at (0,0). Store the coordinates for each number in a position array. Iterate from step 1 to n*n-1, checking if the move from the position of step-1 to the position of step is a valid knight's move.
4. Edge cases: The grid size n can be small (minimum 3). The starting cell grid[0][0] must be 0.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(n^2) due to iterating through the grid and then iterating through the steps. Space complexity is O(n^2) to store the positions of each number.
