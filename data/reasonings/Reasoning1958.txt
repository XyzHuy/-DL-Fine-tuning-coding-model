1. Problem summary: Determine if placing a piece of a given color at a specified empty cell on an 8x8 board creates a "good line" as an endpoint. A good line consists of at least three cells, with the endpoints being the same color and intermediate cells being the opposite color.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Grid traversal, game logic simulation, brute-force checking.
3. Step-by-step approach: Iterate through all 8 possible directions (horizontal, vertical, diagonal) from the target cell. For each direction, traverse outwards checking for a sequence: the initial target cell (to be filled), followed by one or more cells of the opposite color, and finally ending with a cell of the same color as the target. If such a sequence of length at least 3 is found in any direction, the move is legal.
4. Edge cases: The board is always 8x8. The target cell is always empty. The line must have at least 3 cells. The traversal must stay within board boundaries.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(1) because the board size is fixed at 8x8, and we check a constant number of directions with a maximum traversal length of 8 in each direction. Space complexity is O(1) as we only use a few variables for traversal and direction.
