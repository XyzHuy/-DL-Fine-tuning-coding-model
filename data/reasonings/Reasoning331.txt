1. Problem summary: Determine if a given string representing the preorder traversal of a binary tree is valid.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Tree traversal, stack.
3. Step-by-step approach: Use a stack to keep track of available 'slots' for nodes. Each number uses a slot and adds two more. Each '#' uses a slot and doesn't add slots. The stack should be empty at the end if valid.
4. Edge cases: Empty input, single node, incorrect structure.
5. Time and space complexity: Time: O(N), Space: O(N) in the worst case.
