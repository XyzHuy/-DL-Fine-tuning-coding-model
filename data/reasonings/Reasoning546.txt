1. Problem summary: Given an array of colored boxes, maximize the points obtained by removing continuous boxes of the same color. Removing k boxes yields k*k points.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Dynamic Programming (Memoization)
3. Step-by-step approach: Use a recursive function with memoization to explore all possible box removal combinations. The state is defined by the left and right boundaries of the current subarray and the number of boxes of the same color as the leftmost box that are adjacent to it after previous removals. The algorithm explores removing the current continuous segment or merging it with other segments of the same color.
4. Edge cases: Empty input, single element input, input with all same elements. The base case for the recursion is when l > r, which returns 0.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(n^4) and space complexity is O(n^3) due to the memoization table dimensions.
