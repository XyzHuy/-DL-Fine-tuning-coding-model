1. Problem summary: Assign incoming tasks to servers based on server availability, smallest weight, and smallest index, considering task processing times and server release times.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Simulation, Priority Queue (Heap).
3. Step-by-step approach: Maintain two priority queues: one for available servers (sorted by weight then index) and one for busy servers (sorted by completion time). Iterate through time, freeing up busy servers, assigning new tasks to available servers, and updating busy servers. If no servers are available, advance time to when the next server becomes free.
4. Edge cases: No servers available when a task arrives, multiple servers becoming free simultaneously, all tasks processed.
5. Time and space complexity: Time O(N log N + M log N), Space O(N + M) where N is the number of servers and M is the number of tasks.
