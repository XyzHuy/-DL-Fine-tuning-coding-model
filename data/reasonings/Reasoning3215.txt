1. Problem summary: Count triplets (a[i], b[j], c[k]) where the bitwise XOR sum has an even number of set bits.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Bit Manipulation, Counting, Combinatorics.
3. Step-by-step approach: For each array, count elements with an even number of set bits (even parity) and an odd number of set bits (odd parity). A triplet XOR sum has an even number of set bits if either all three numbers have even parity, or exactly one number has even parity and the other two have odd parity. Sum the counts for these valid combinations.
4. Edge cases: Empty input arrays are not possible due to constraints. Large integer values are handled by standard bitwise operations and bit_count().
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(N + M + P) where N, M, P are lengths of arrays a, b, c, due to iterating through each array once. Space complexity is O(1) as only a few counters are used.
