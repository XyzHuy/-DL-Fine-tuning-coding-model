1. Problem summary: Given a string s and an integer k, find the lexicographically smallest string that can be obtained by repeatedly moving one of the first k characters to the end of the string.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: String manipulation, sorting (when k > 1), rotation (when k = 1).
3. Step-by-step approach: If k > 1, we can move any character to any position, thus we can sort the string. If k = 1, we can only rotate the string. We iterate through all rotations and find the lexicographically smallest one.
4. Edge cases: k=1 and k>1 are the main edge cases that determine the logic. Empty string is not a possible input based on the constraints.
5. Time and space complexity: When k > 1, the time complexity is O(n log n) for sorting and space complexity is O(n). When k = 1, the time complexity is O(n^2) because of string comparisons in the loop, and the space complexity is O(n) to store the concatenated string and the smallest rotation.
