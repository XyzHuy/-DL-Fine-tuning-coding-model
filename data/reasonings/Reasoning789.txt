1. Problem summary: Determine if the player can reach the target before any ghost, given the ghost positions and target position.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Geometry, Manhattan Distance.
3. Step-by-step approach: Calculate the Manhattan distance from the starting point (0,0) to the target. For each ghost, calculate the Manhattan distance to the target. If any ghost's distance to the target is less than or equal to the player's distance to the target, return false. Otherwise, return true.
4. Edge cases: Empty ghosts list, ghosts at the same location, target at origin.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(n), where n is the number of ghosts. Space complexity is O(1).
