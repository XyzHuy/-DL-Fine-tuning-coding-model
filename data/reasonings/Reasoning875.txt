1. Problem summary: Find the minimum eating speed (k) such that Koko can finish all piles of bananas within h hours.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Binary Search.
3. Step-by-step approach: Use binary search to find the minimum eating speed k. The search space is from 1 to the maximum number of bananas in a pile. For each mid value, calculate the total hours needed to eat all piles at speed k. If the total hours are less than or equal to h, try a smaller speed (right = mid - 1). Otherwise, increase the speed (left = mid + 1).
4. Edge cases: The minimum possible speed is 1, and the maximum possible speed is the largest pile size. Also, the number of piles is less than or equal to h.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(N log M), where N is the number of piles and M is the maximum number of bananas in a pile. Space complexity is O(1).
