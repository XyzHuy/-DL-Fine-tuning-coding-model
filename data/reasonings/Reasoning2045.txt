1. Problem summary: Find the second shortest time to travel from node 1 to node n in a graph, considering edge traversal time and traffic light cycles at each node that can cause delays.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Graph traversal (specifically a modified Breadth-First Search or Dijkstra-like algorithm) to find shortest paths considering dynamic conditions.
3. Step-by-step approach: Build an adjacency list for the graph. Use BFS starting from node 1, storing the arrival time and the count of times a node has been visited at that specific time. When a node n is reached for the second distinct time, that's the answer. Calculate waiting time at nodes if the traffic light is red when arriving.
4. Edge cases: The graph is connected. All signals turn green at the start. A node can be revisited multiple times. The minimum and second minimum times might involve paths with cycles.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(N*K) where K is the maximum number of times we might need to visit a node to find the second shortest path (in this case, K=2 for distinct arrival times at each node). Space complexity is O(N*K) to store visited times for each node.
