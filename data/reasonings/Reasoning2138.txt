1. Problem summary: Partition a string into groups of size k, padding the last group with a fill character if necessary.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: String manipulation, iteration.
3. Step-by-step approach: Iterate through the string with a step size of k. For each segment, extract a substring of length k. If the substring is shorter than k, append the fill character repeatedly until it reaches length k. Add the constructed group to a result list.
4. Edge cases: The string length might not be a multiple of k, requiring padding for the last group. The string length could be less than k.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(N) where N is the length of the string, as each character is processed once. Space complexity is O(N) to store the resulting list of strings.
