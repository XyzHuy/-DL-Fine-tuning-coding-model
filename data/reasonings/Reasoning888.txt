1. Problem summary: Alice and Bob want to exchange candy boxes to have the same total candy amount. The goal is to find one such exchange pair.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Array manipulation, Hash set, Arithmetic.
3. Step-by-step approach: Calculate the total candy for Alice and Bob. Find the difference between their totals, then divide by 2 to find the required change. Iterate through Alice's candy sizes, and for each candy size, calculate the corresponding candy size that Bob should have to make the totals equal after the exchange. Use a set to efficiently check if Bob has the required candy size. If found, return the pair.
4. Edge cases: The problem statement guarantees at least one solution exists and that Alice and Bob have different total candies. Therefore, no explicit edge cases need to be handled.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(n + m), where n is the length of aliceSizes and m is the length of bobSizes, due to the sum calculations and the loop with set lookup. Space complexity is O(m) due to the creation of the Bob's candy sizes set.
