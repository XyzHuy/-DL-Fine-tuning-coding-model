1. Problem summary: Find the smallest palindrome that can be formed by rearranging the digits of a given large palindrome number, which is lexicographically larger than the input.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Next lexicographical permutation on the first half of the palindrome.
3. Step-by-step approach: Treat the first half of the palindrome as a string. Find the next lexicographical permutation of this first half. If a next permutation exists, reconstruct the full palindrome. If not, return an empty string.
4. Edge cases: When no next lexicographical permutation can be found for the first half (e.g., the first half is in descending order), indicating no larger palindrome can be formed.
5. Time and space complexity: O(N) time to find the permutation and construct the palindrome, O(N) space to store and manipulate the string halves, where N is the length of the input number.
