1. Problem summary: Assign tasks to workers, where workers have strength requirements and workers have their own strength, with an option to use pills to boost worker strength, maximizing completed tasks.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Binary search on the answer combined with a greedy approach using a sorted list or multiset.
3. Step-by-step approach: Sort tasks and workers. Binary search for the maximum number of tasks 'k' that can be completed. For a given 'k', use the 'k' strongest workers and the 'k' easiest tasks. Iterate through tasks from hardest to easiest within the 'k' tasks. For each task, try to assign the weakest available worker who can complete it without a pill. If no such worker exists, use a pill if available and assign the weakest worker capable of completing it with a pill.
4. Edge cases: No tasks, no workers, no pills, strength of 0, task requirements or worker strengths exceeding typical integer limits. Cases where all workers can complete all tasks, or no tasks can be completed.
5. Time and space complexity: Sorting takes O(N log N + M log M). Binary search performs log(min(N, M)) iterations. Inside the binary search, the can_assign function with a sorted list takes O(k log k) for initial setup and O(k log k) for iterations, where k is the number of tasks being checked. Thus, overall time complexity is O((N log N + M log M) + min(N, M) * k log k). Space complexity is O(M) for the sorted list of workers.
