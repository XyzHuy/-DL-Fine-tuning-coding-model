1. Problem summary: Given a string and a dictionary of words, determine if the string can be segmented into a space-separated sequence of dictionary words.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Dynamic Programming.
3. Step-by-step approach: Create a DP array where dp[i] represents whether the substring s[0:i] can be segmented. Initialize dp[0] to true. Iterate through the string, and for each index i, iterate from j=0 to i. If dp[j] is true and the substring s[j:i] is in the word dictionary, then dp[i] is true.
4. Edge cases: Empty string, empty wordDict, no possible segmentation.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(n*n) where n is the length of the string s. Space complexity is O(n) for the DP array.
