1. Problem summary: Determine the minimum operations to transform a given n x n grid (where n is odd) into a valid "Letter Y" formation, by changing cell values. A valid Y requires cells forming the Y shape to have one uniform value, cells outside the Y to have another uniform value, and these two values must be different.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Grid traversal, counting, optimization.
3. Step-by-step approach: Identify cells belonging to the Y shape (top-left to center diagonal, top-right to center diagonal, center to bottom vertical) and cells not belonging to the Y. Count the occurrences of each digit (0, 1, 2) in both Y-cells and non-Y-cells. Iterate through all possible pairs of distinct values for Y-cells and non-Y-cells. For each pair, calculate the operations needed to achieve that configuration and find the minimum among them.
4. Edge cases: The grid size n is guaranteed to be at least 3 and odd. All cell values are within 0, 1, or 2. The constraints ensure a well-defined center and Y shape.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(n^2) for grid traversal and O(1) for checking value combinations (since there are only 3 possible values, thus 3*2 = 6 combinations for distinct Y and non-Y values). Space complexity is O(1) as counters store at most 3 distinct keys.
