1. Problem summary: Determine if a given word can be found in a grid of characters, where the word is formed by sequentially adjacent cells (horizontally or vertically) and each cell can only be used once.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Backtracking / Depth-First Search (DFS).
3. Step-by-step approach: Iterate through each cell in the board and start a DFS search from that cell. The DFS function checks if the current cell matches the character at the current index of the word. If it does, recursively explore the adjacent cells. Before the recursive calls, mark the current cell as visited to avoid reusing it. After the calls, revert the cell to its original value to allow it to be used in other search paths.
4. Edge cases: Empty board, empty word, word longer than the board dimensions, word not present in the board.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(M * N * 4^L), where M is the number of rows, N is the number of columns, and L is the length of the word. Space complexity is O(L) due to the recursion depth of the DFS.
