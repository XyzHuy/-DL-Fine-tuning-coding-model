1. Problem summary: Find the smallest positive integer startValue such that the cumulative sum of startValue and array elements, from left to right, is always at least 1.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Iterative prefix sum calculation and minimum value tracking.
3. Step-by-step approach: Iterate through the array, maintaining a running sum. If the running sum ever drops below 1, calculate the required increase in startValue to bring that sum up to 1 and update the minimum startValue needed. The minimum startValue must be at least 1.
4. Edge cases: The minimum startValue itself must be at least 1. The array can contain positive or negative numbers.
5. Time and space complexity: O(n) time complexity for a single pass through the array, O(1) space complexity as only a few variables are used.
