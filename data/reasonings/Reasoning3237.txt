1. Problem summary: Simulate bringing specific windows to the top and return the final order.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Data structure manipulation, simulating operations.
3. Step-by-step approach: Use a deque to represent windows for efficient front insertion. For each query, remove the window if present and then add it to the front.
4. Edge cases: The queried window might not be currently in the list (though constraints imply it will be, but if not, it's simply added to the front). All windows are unique.
5. Time and space complexity: Time O(Q * N) in worst case for deque.remove, Space O(N) for deque.
