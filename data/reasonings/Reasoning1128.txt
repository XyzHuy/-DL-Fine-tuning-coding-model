1. Problem summary: Count the number of equivalent domino pairs in a list, where equivalence is defined as either identical dominoes or dominoes that can be made identical by rotation.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Hashing/Counting, Array Traversal.
3. Step-by-step approach: Iterate through the dominoes, normalize each domino by sorting its elements to treat rotations as the same domino. Use a hash map (dictionary) to count the occurrences of each normalized domino. For each domino, add the current count of its normalized form to the result, then increment the count.
4. Edge cases: Empty input list, list with only one domino, list with all identical dominoes, list with no equivalent dominoes.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(n), where n is the number of dominoes. Space complexity is O(n) in the worst case (all dominoes are distinct), but practically O(1) because domino values are limited to 1-9, and the normalized form becomes the key.
