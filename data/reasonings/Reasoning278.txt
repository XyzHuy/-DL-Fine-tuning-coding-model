1. Problem summary: Find the first bad version in a range of versions [1, n], given that all versions after a bad version are also bad.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Binary Search
3. Step-by-step approach: Use binary search to narrow down the range of possible bad versions. If the middle version is bad, search in the left half. Otherwise, search in the right half.
4. Edge cases: n = 1, the first version is bad, the first version is good
5. Time and space complexity: O(log n) time complexity, O(1) space complexity
