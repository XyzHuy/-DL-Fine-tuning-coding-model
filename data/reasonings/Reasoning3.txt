1. Problem summary: Find the length of the longest substring within a given string that contains no repeating characters.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: String manipulation, sliding window, hash map.
3. Step-by-step approach: Use a sliding window approach, tracking the start of the window and the last seen index of each character in a hash map. When a repeating character is encountered within the current window, move the start of the window to the right of the previous occurrence. Keep track of the longest substring seen so far.
4. Edge cases: Empty string.
5. Time and space complexity: O(n) time, O(min(m, n)) space where n is the length of the string and m is the size of the character set.
