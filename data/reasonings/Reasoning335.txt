1. Problem summary: Determine if a path described by a list of distances in a counter-clockwise direction self-intersects.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Geometry, Array Traversal, Simulation
3. Step-by-step approach: Iterate through the distance array starting from the fourth element and check for three possible crossing scenarios based on the relative lengths of previous segments.
4. Edge cases: If the number of distances is less than 4, the path cannot self-intersect.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(n) due to the single loop. Space complexity is O(1) as it uses a constant amount of extra space.
