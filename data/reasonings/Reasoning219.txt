1. Problem summary: Determine if there are two identical numbers in an array whose indices differ by at most k.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Hashing, Array Traversal.
3. Step-by-step approach: Iterate through the array, using a dictionary to store the last seen index of each number. For each number, check if it is in the dictionary and if the difference between the current index and the last seen index is less than or equal to k. If so, return true. Otherwise, update the last seen index of the number. If the loop finishes without finding such a pair, return false.
4. Edge cases: Empty array, k = 0, duplicate numbers at the beginning or end of array, large k values.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(n), where n is the length of the array, due to iterating through the array once. Space complexity is O(n) in the worst case, where n is the number of distinct elements in the array, as we store each element's index in the hash map.
