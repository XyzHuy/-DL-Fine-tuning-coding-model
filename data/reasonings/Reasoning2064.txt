1. Problem summary: Distribute products of various quantities to n stores, where each store gets at most one product type. Minimize the maximum number of products any single store receives.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Binary Search on Answer (or Monotonicity) combined with Greedy distribution check.
3. Step-by-step approach: The minimum possible maximum number of products per store is within a range. We can binary search for this optimal maximum value 'x'. For a given 'x', we check if it's possible to distribute all products such that no store receives more than 'x' products using n stores. This check involves calculating the minimum number of stores required for each product type (ceiling division of quantity by x) and summing them up. If the total stores required is less than or equal to n, then 'x' is feasible, and we try a smaller 'x'; otherwise, we need a larger 'x'.
4. Edge cases: n=1 (the single store gets all products), quantities can be large, all quantities can be small. The binary search range must be appropriate (e.g., 1 to max(quantities)).
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(m * log(max_quantity)) where m is the number of product types, due to binary search. Space complexity is O(1) (excluding input storage).
