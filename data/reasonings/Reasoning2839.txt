1. Problem summary: Determine if two 4-character strings s1 and s2 can be made equal by swapping characters at indices i and j where j - i = 2, any number of times.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: String manipulation, character permutation analysis.
3. Step-by-step approach: Analyze the allowed swap operation. Swapping characters with a distance of 2 means characters at even indices can be rearranged among themselves, and characters at odd indices can be rearranged among themselves. Therefore, check if the sorted characters at even indices of s1 match the sorted characters at even indices of s2, AND if the sorted characters at odd indices of s1 match the sorted characters at odd indices of s2.
4. Edge cases: The problem statement guarantees strings of length 4. No explicit edge cases beyond this are mentioned, but the logic naturally handles any valid character combinations within the 4-character constraint.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is dominated by sorting the characters at even and odd indices, which for fixed length 4 strings is constant time. Space complexity is also constant as we are only creating temporary lists/sorted versions of small subsets of characters.
