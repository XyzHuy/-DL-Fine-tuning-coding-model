1. Problem summary: Given a time string "hh:mm" with potential '?' characters, count the number of valid 24-hour clock times that can be formed by replacing each '?' with a digit.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Brute-force enumeration with pattern matching.
3. Step-by-step approach: Iterate through all possible valid hours (00 to 23) and all possible valid minutes (00 to 59). For each combination, format it into "hh:mm" and check if it matches the input time string's pattern (where '?' matches any digit). Sum up the matching combinations.
4. Edge cases: The input string might have zero, one, or multiple '?' characters in both the hour and minute parts. The hour and minute constraints (00-23, 00-59) must be strictly followed.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(24 * 60) because we iterate through all possible hours and minutes, and for each, string comparison takes constant time. Space complexity is O(1) as we only use a few variables.
