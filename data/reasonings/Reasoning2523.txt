1. Problem summary: Find the pair of prime numbers (num1, num2) within a given range [left, right] such that num1 < num2 and their difference is minimized. If multiple pairs have the minimum difference, return the one with the smallest num1.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Number Theory (Prime Numbers), Brute Force, Iteration.
3. Step-by-step approach: First, generate all prime numbers within the range [left, right] using a primality test. Then, iterate through the list of found prime numbers, calculating the difference between consecutive primes and tracking the minimum difference and the corresponding pair.
4. Edge cases: The range contains fewer than two prime numbers, in which case return [-1, -1]. The case where left or right is 1, as 1 is not prime.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is dominated by primality testing for each number in the range, approximately O((right - left) * sqrt(right)). Space complexity is O(P) where P is the number of primes in the range, for storing the primes.
