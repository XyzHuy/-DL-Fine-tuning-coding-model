1. Problem summary: Given an array of digit strings and queries, for each query, trim numbers to a specified length from the right, find the k-th smallest among them (maintaining original index for ties), and return its original index. The numbers revert to original length after each query.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Sorting, String manipulation.
3. Step-by-step approach: For each query, create pairs of (rightmost trim_length digits, original index). Sort these pairs. Return the original index of the k-th element in the sorted list.
4. Edge cases: Leading zeros in trimmed numbers are handled by string comparison. Ties in trimmed numbers are broken by original index. k can be 1 up to the number of strings.
5. Time and space complexity: For each query: O(N * L + N log N) time for trimming and sorting, where N is nums.length and L is the max string length. Total time O(Q * (N * L + N log N)). Space O(N) for storing trimmed numbers and indices.
