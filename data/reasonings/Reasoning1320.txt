1. Problem summary: Calculate the minimum distance to type a given word using two fingers, where fingers can be initially placed freely and the distance is Manhattan distance between letter coordinates.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Dynamic Programming with memoization.
3. Step-by-step approach: Define a DP state dp(i, f1, f2) representing the minimum cost to type the suffix of the word starting from index i, with finger 1 currently at character f1 and finger 2 at character f2. The base case is when i reaches the end of the word, returning 0. For each state, explore two transitions: assign the current character word[i] to finger 1 (updating f1 and adding distance) or to finger 2 (updating f2 and adding distance). Use memoization to store and reuse computed results. The initial call considers fingers starting at None.
4. Edge cases: The initial positions of the fingers are considered free (cost 0), represented by None for the initial finger positions. The word length is at least 2.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(N * 26 * 26) due to iterating through N characters and 26x26 possible previous finger positions. Space complexity is O(N * 26 * 26) for the memoization table.
