1. Problem summary: Calculate the sum of values of all nodes in a binary tree that have a grandparent with an even value.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Tree Traversal (Depth-First Search or Breadth-First Search).
3. Step-by-step approach: Traverse the tree, keeping track of the current node's parent and grandparent. For each node, check if its grandparent exists and has an even value. If so, add the current node's value to a running sum.
4. Edge cases: An empty tree (root is None) or a tree with only one or two levels, where no node has a grandparent.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(N) because each node is visited once. Space complexity is O(H) in the worst case for DFS due to recursion stack, where H is the height of the tree (O(log N) for balanced, O(N) for skewed). For BFS, space complexity is O(W) for the queue, where W is the maximum width of the tree (O(N) in worst case).
