1. Problem summary: Create the maximum number of groups with distinct elements, where group lengths must strictly increase, and each number i is used at most usageLimits[i] times.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Greedy approach with mathematical formulation.
3. Step-by-step approach: Sort usageLimits. Iterate through the sorted limits, accumulating the total available usage. If the cumulative usage is sufficient to form the next group of increasing length (sum of 1 to k), increment the group count.
4. Edge cases: All usageLimits are 1, meaning only one group can be formed with single distinct elements. Large usageLimits that allow many groups.
5. Time and space complexity: Time O(N log N) due to sorting, Space O(1) or O(N) depending on sort implementation.
