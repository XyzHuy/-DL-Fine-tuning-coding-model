1. Problem summary: Calculate the minimum number of rests to skip when traveling through a series of roads with given distances and a constant speed, to arrive within a specified total hours. Each road travel time is rounded up to the nearest integer hour for rest, unless the rest is skipped.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Dynamic Programming. Specifically, a variation of DP on intervals or paths where states represent the number of skips used.
3. Step-by-step approach: Use dynamic programming. `dp[i][j]` represents the minimum time to reach the end of road `i` using exactly `j` skips. Iterate through roads and number of skips, calculating the time to reach the current road by either skipping the previous rest (adding only road travel time) or not skipping (adding rounded-up travel time for the previous road plus current road travel time). Finally, find the minimum skips `j` such that `dp[n-1][j]` is less than or equal to `hoursBefore * speed`.
4. Edge cases: The total travel time might be impossible to meet even with all rests skipped. The last road does not require a rest after it. If the total time is exactly an integer hour without rounding up, no wait is needed for that segment.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(n^2) due to nested loops iterating through roads and skips. Space complexity is O(n^2) for storing the DP table.
