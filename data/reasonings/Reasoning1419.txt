1. Problem summary: Determine the minimum number of frogs required to produce a given string of "croak" sounds, where each frog must complete the "croak" sequence sequentially. Return -1 if the string is invalid.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: String manipulation, Greedy approach, Counting.
3. Step-by-step approach: Iterate through the input string, maintaining counts of 'c', 'r', 'o', 'a', and 'k' characters encountered so far. For each character, update its count. Ensure that the counts maintain a valid sequential order (e.g., 'r' count cannot exceed 'c' count). Track the maximum concurrent 'c' count, representing active frogs. When a 'k' is encountered, it signifies a completed "croak," so decrement all character counts. Finally, verify that all character counts are zero after processing the string.
4. Edge cases: The input string might be too short to form a valid "croak", or it might contain invalid characters or sequences that break the 'c' -> 'r' -> 'o' -> 'a' -> 'k' progression. Also, leftover counts for characters other than 'k' at the end indicate an incomplete croak.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(N) where N is the length of the input string, as we iterate through it once. Space complexity is O(1) because we only use a fixed-size array (size 5) to store character counts, regardless of the input string length.
