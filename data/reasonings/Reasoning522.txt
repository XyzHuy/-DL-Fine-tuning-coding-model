1. Problem summary: Find the length of the longest uncommon subsequence (LUS) from a given list of strings. An uncommon subsequence is a string that is a subsequence of one string but not a subsequence of any other string in the list.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: String manipulation, subsequence checking, sorting.
3. Step-by-step approach: Sort the strings by length in descending order. Iterate through the sorted strings, and for each string, check if it is a subsequence of any other string in the list. If it is not a subsequence of any other string, then it is an uncommon subsequence. Return the length of the first uncommon subsequence found. If no uncommon subsequence is found, return -1.
4. Edge cases: Empty list of strings, all strings are the same, one string is a subsequence of another.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(N^2 * L), where N is the number of strings and L is the maximum length of a string. Space complexity is O(1).
