1. Problem summary: Calculate the sum of squares of elements in a 1-indexed array where the index divides the array length.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Array traversal, basic arithmetic.
3. Step-by-step approach: Iterate through the array using 0-based indexing. For each element, check if its 1-based index is a divisor of the array's length. If it is, square the element and add it to a running sum.
4. Edge cases: The array length is at least 1. All elements and indices are positive.
5. Time and space complexity: O(n) time complexity for iterating through the array, and O(1) space complexity as only a few variables are used.
