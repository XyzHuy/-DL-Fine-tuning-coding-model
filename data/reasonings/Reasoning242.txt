1. Problem summary: Determine if string t is an anagram of string s.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: String manipulation / Hash table (counting characters).
3. Step-by-step approach: Check if the lengths are equal. Count the frequency of characters in the first string. Decrement the counts based on characters in the second string. Return true if all counts are zero, false otherwise.
4. Edge cases: Strings of different lengths, empty strings, strings with Unicode characters (would require a larger character set or Unicode-aware counting).
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(n), where n is the length of the strings. Space complexity is O(1) because the size of the character set is fixed (26 lowercase English letters).
