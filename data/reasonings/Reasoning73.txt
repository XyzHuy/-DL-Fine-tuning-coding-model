1. Problem summary: Given a matrix, if any element is zero, set its entire row and column to zero. Perform this in-place.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Matrix manipulation / In-place modification
3. Step-by-step approach: Use the first row and first column as flags to indicate which rows and columns should be zeroed. First, check if the first row or column initially contain zeros. Then, iterate through the rest of the matrix, setting the corresponding first row/column element to 0 if a zero is encountered. Finally, iterate through the matrix (excluding the first row/column) again and set elements to 0 based on the flags in the first row and column. Handle the first row and column separately based on their initial zero states.
4. Edge cases: Empty matrix or a matrix with empty rows. Matrix containing only one row/column.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(m*n) due to iterating through the matrix multiple times. Space complexity is O(1) because it's done in-place using the matrix itself for storage.
