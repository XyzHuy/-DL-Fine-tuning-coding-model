1. Problem summary: Find the maximum number of characters to remove from string s, using a given order of indices, such that string p remains a subsequence of s.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Binary Search on the answer, Subsequence checking.
3. Step-by-step approach: Binary search on the possible number of removals (k). For a given k, simulate the removal of the first k characters specified by the removable array. Then, check if p is still a subsequence of the modified s. Adjust the binary search range based on the check.
4. Edge cases: p is an empty string (though constraint states p.length >= 1), s is empty (constraint states s.length >= 1), removable is empty, all characters are removed.
5. Time and space complexity: Time is O((N + M) * log R), where N is length of s, M is length of p, R is length of removable. Space is O(N) for storing modified s.
