1. Problem summary: Find the minimum time (greater than zero) for a string to return to its initial state by repeatedly removing k characters from the start and adding k characters to the end.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: String manipulation, pattern matching, simulation.
3. Step-by-step approach: Simulate the process second by second. After `time` seconds, `k * time` characters have been effectively removed from the prefix and re-added to the suffix. Check if the remaining suffix of the original string matches the prefix of the original string of the same length. The first `time` for which this match occurs is the answer. If `k * time` exceeds the string length, the entire string would have been processed, and it will revert.
4. Edge cases: When `k` is equal to the length of the string, it reverts in 1 second. When `k` is such that `k * time` becomes greater than or equal to the length of the string.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(N*M) where N is string length and M is number of iterations, but in worst case M can be N/K which is O(N/K). The comparison `word[k * time:] == word[:n - k * time]` takes O(N-k*time) time. Space complexity is O(1).
