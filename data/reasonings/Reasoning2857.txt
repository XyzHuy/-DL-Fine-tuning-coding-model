1. Problem summary: Count pairs of points (i, j) with i < j such that the XOR distance (x_i XOR x_j) + (y_i XOR y_j) equals k.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Hash Map / Dictionary, Counting pairs, Bitwise Operations.
3. Step-by-step approach: Iterate through each point. For each point (x, y), iterate through all possible XOR differences for the x-coordinate from 0 to k. Calculate the required XOR difference for the y-coordinate. Check if a point with these required XOR values exists in a hash map storing counts of previously seen points. Add the count of such points to the total. Then, increment the count of the current point in the hash map.
4. Edge cases: k = 0, duplicate coordinates, large number of coordinates.
5. Time and space complexity: Time O(N*k), Space O(N) where N is the number of coordinates.
