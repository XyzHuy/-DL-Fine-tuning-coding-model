1. Problem summary: Calculate a new matrix where each cell's value is the absolute difference between the number of distinct elements on its top-left diagonal and its bottom-right diagonal.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Matrix traversal, Brute force.
3. Step-by-step approach: Iterate through each cell (r, c) in the grid. For each cell, trace back the top-left diagonal to collect its values and count distinct elements. Then, trace forward the bottom-right diagonal to collect its values and count distinct elements. Finally, compute the absolute difference between these two counts and store it in the answer matrix at (r, c).
4. Edge cases: A 1x1 grid, where both diagonals are empty resulting in 0 distinct elements.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(m * n * (m + n)) due to nested loops and diagonal traversals. Space complexity is O(m * n) for the answer matrix and O(m + n) for temporary diagonal storage.
