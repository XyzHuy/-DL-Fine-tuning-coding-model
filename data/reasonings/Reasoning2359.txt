1. Problem summary: Find a node reachable from both node1 and node2 in a directed graph where each node has at most one outgoing edge, minimizing the maximum distance from node1 and node2 to that node.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Graph traversal, Breadth-First Search (BFS) or Depth-First Search (DFS) concept applied.
3. Step-by-step approach: First, perform a traversal (like DFS) starting from node1 to calculate distances to all reachable nodes. Then, perform a similar traversal from node2. Finally, iterate through all nodes, checking if they are reachable from both and identifying the one that minimizes the maximum distance, prioritizing smaller node indices in case of ties.
4. Edge cases: Nodes that are part of a cycle, nodes with no outgoing edges (edges[i] == -1), nodes unreachable from one or both starting points, and scenarios where no common reachable node exists.
5. Time and space complexity: O(N) time complexity due to traversals from each node and iteration through all nodes. O(N) space complexity for storing distances.
