1. Problem summary: Find the leftmost value in the last row of a given binary tree.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Tree traversal / Breadth-First Search (BFS).
3. Step-by-step approach: Use level-order traversal (BFS). Keep track of the leftmost node's value at each level. The last leftmost node encountered is the answer.
4. Edge cases: Empty tree (should not happen based on constraints), single node tree, skewed trees.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(N), where N is the number of nodes, as we visit each node once. Space complexity is O(W), where W is the maximum width of the tree, due to the queue used in BFS. In the worst case (complete binary tree), W is approximately N/2, so the space complexity can be considered O(N).
