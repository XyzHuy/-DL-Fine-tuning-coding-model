1. Problem summary: Determine if two strings of equal length can be made identical by swapping characters at even-indexed positions with other even-indexed positions and odd-indexed positions with other odd-indexed positions.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: String manipulation, sorting, character counting.
3. Step-by-step approach: Separate characters of s1 into even and odd indexed groups and sort them. Do the same for s2. Compare the sorted even groups and sorted odd groups. If both pairs match, return true; otherwise, return false.
4. Edge cases: Strings of length 1. All characters being the same.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(N log N) due to sorting. Space complexity is O(N) for storing the sorted character lists.
