1. Problem summary: Determine if a target cell (fx, fy) can be reached from a starting cell (sx, sy) in exactly t seconds, moving to adjacent cells each second on an infinite 2D grid.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Math / Geometry (Chebyshev distance).
3. Step-by-step approach: Calculate the minimum time (Chebyshev distance) required to reach the destination. If the start and end are the same, return true if t is not 1, otherwise false. If they are different, return true if t is greater than or equal to the calculated minimum time, otherwise false.
4. Edge cases: The start and end coordinates are identical.
5. Time and space complexity: O(1) time and O(1) space.
