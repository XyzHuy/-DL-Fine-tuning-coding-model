1. Problem summary: Find the smallest team of people such that for every required skill, at least one person in the team has that skill. Return the indices of the people in the team.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Dynamic Programming, Bit Manipulation. The problem is a variation of the set cover problem, which can be solved using DP.
3. Step-by-step approach: Convert the skills to bitmasks. Iterate through all possible subsets of skills (represented as bitmasks) and for each subset, iterate through all people. Update the minimum team size required to cover that subset of skills by adding each person to the potential team and taking the minimum. Backtrack to find the team members.
4. Edge cases: The constraints guarantee a solution exists.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(2^n * m), where n is the number of required skills and m is the number of people. Space complexity is O(2^n), for storing the DP table.
