1. Problem summary: Given a binary string representing tiles and a number of black carpets of a fixed length, minimize the visible white tiles by strategically placing carpets.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Dynamic Programming.
3. Step-by-step approach: Initialize a DP table where dp[i][j] represents the minimum visible white tiles for the first i tiles using j carpets. The recurrence relation considers two choices for the i-th tile: either it's not covered by a new carpet (inheriting from dp[i-1][j] and adding current tile's white status), or it's covered by the end of a new carpet (dp[max(0, i-carpetLen)][j-1]). The base case is dp[0][j] = 0. The final answer is dp[n][numCarpets].
4. Edge cases: When there are no tiles (n=0), the result is 0. When no carpets are available (numCarpets=0), all white tiles are visible. When carpetLen is 1, each carpet covers exactly one tile. When carpetLen is greater than or equal to the floor length, all white tiles can potentially be covered with one carpet if numCarpets >= 1.
5. Time and space complexity: O(n * numCarpets) time complexity due to iterating through the DP table, and O(n * numCarpets) space complexity for the DP table.
