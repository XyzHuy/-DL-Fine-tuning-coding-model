1. Problem summary: Determine if string target can be obtained from string start by moving 'L' pieces left and 'R' pieces right, only to blank spaces.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Two Pointers, String Manipulation.
3. Step-by-step approach: First, remove all '_' from both strings and check if the remaining characters are identical. Then, iterate through the non-underscore characters of start and target simultaneously. For each 'L', ensure its start index is less than or equal to its target index. For each 'R', ensure its start index is greater than or equal to its target index.
4. Edge cases: The strings start and target can have different arrangements of 'L', 'R', and '_', but the sequence of 'L' and 'R' pieces must be the same, and their relative positions must be valid for movement.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(n) due to linear scans. Space complexity is O(n) in the worst case to store filtered character positions.
