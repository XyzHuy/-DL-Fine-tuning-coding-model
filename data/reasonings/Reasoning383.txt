1. Problem summary: Determine if a ransom note can be constructed from a magazine string using each magazine character only once.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: String manipulation, hashmap/counter.
3. Step-by-step approach: Count character frequencies in both strings using Counter. Iterate through the ransomNote's character counts and check if magazine has enough of each character.
4. Edge cases: Empty strings (implicitly handled), ransomNote longer than magazine, characters in ransomNote not present in magazine.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(m + n) where m and n are the lengths of ransomNote and magazine respectively. Space complexity is O(1) since we only store counts of lowercase English letters (at most 26).
