1. Problem summary: Find the number of "lonely" black pixels in a 2D grid, where a pixel is lonely if it's the only black pixel in its row and column.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Array traversal, counting, and conditional checking.
3. Step-by-step approach: First, iterate through the grid and count the number of black pixels in each row and column. Then, iterate through the grid again, and for each black pixel, check if its row and column have a count of 1. If so, increment the lonely pixel count.
4. Edge cases: Empty input grid.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(m*n), where m is the number of rows and n is the number of columns. Space complexity is O(m+n) to store the row and column counts.
