1. Problem summary: Determine the maximum number of monsters that can be eliminated before any monster reaches the city, given their initial distances and speeds, and considering the weapon's one-minute charge time.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Greedy algorithm, sorting.
3. Step-by-step approach: Calculate the time each monster takes to reach the city (distance / speed), round up to the nearest minute. Sort these arrival times. Iterate through the sorted arrival times, eliminating monsters one by one. If the current monster's arrival time is less than or equal to the current minute (which also represents the number of monsters already eliminated), then we lose. Otherwise, we can eliminate this monster.
4. Edge cases: All monsters can be eliminated. A monster reaches the city exactly when the weapon is ready to fire for the next monster. No monsters can be eliminated.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is dominated by sorting, O(N log N). Space complexity is O(N) for storing arrival times, or O(1) if modifying input or if sorting is in-place and does not require auxiliary space beyond the input structure.
