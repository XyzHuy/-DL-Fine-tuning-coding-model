1. Problem summary: Minimize bit flips in an array such that the XOR sum of its elements equals k.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Bitwise operations, XOR properties.
3. Step-by-step approach: First, calculate the XOR sum of all elements in the initial array. Then, determine the XOR difference between this current XOR sum and the target k. The number of set bits (1s) in this XOR difference directly corresponds to the minimum number of bit flips required. Each bit flip can change the overall XOR sum by toggling a specific bit.
4. Edge cases: An empty array is not possible per constraints. If the initial XOR sum already equals k, the operations needed are 0.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(N) due to iterating through the array once. Space complexity is O(1) as only a few variables are used.
