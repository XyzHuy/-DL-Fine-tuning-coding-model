1. Problem summary: Find the smallest integer greater than k, divisible by k, and composed solely of digit1 and/or digit2.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Breadth-First Search (BFS) for number generation and searching.
3. Step-by-step approach: Use a BFS queue starting with digit1 and digit2 (if non-zero). For each number dequeued, check if it's greater than k and a multiple of k. If so, return it. Otherwise, generate new numbers by appending digit1 and digit2, ensuring they don't exceed the 32-bit integer limit, and enqueue them.
4. Edge cases: Handling cases where digit1 and digit2 are the same, one or both are zero, the smallest valid number exceeds the 32-bit integer limit, or no such number exists.
5. Time and space complexity: The time complexity is related to the number of valid integers that can be formed and checked before finding a solution or exhausting possibilities, potentially exponential in the number of digits but bounded by the 32-bit integer limit. Space complexity is also related to the maximum size of the BFS queue, bounded by the number of reachable valid integers within the limit.
