1. Problem summary: Identify employees with three or more system access times within any one-hour window on the same day.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Hash map/dictionary and sorting.
3. Step-by-step approach: Group access times by employee, convert times to minutes, sort each employee's times, and then iterate through sorted times to find if any three fall within a 60-minute difference.
4. Edge cases: Times exactly one hour apart are not considered contiguous; access times at the start/end of the day are handled by minute conversion.
5. Time and space complexity: Time O(N log N) due to sorting per employee, Space O(N) to store employee access times.
