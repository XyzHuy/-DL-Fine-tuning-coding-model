1. Problem summary: Calculate the number of valid pickup and delivery sequences for n orders, ensuring each delivery occurs after its corresponding pickup, modulo 10^9 + 7.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Combinatorics, Dynamic Programming (implicitly) or Mathematical Formula.
3. Step-by-step approach: For n orders, consider adding the (n+1)-th order. The (n+1)-th pickup can be placed in any of the current 2n slots. The (n+1)-th delivery must be placed after its pickup, and there are 2n+1 total slots now available for it, but its placement is constrained by the pickup. The number of valid positions for delivery is (2*(n+1)-1). So, for each additional order, we multiply by (i * (2*i - 1)) for i from 2 to n, modulo MOD.
4. Edge cases: When n=1, there is only one order (P1, D1), resulting in 1 valid sequence. The loop starts from i=2.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(n) due to the single loop iterating up to n. Space complexity is O(1) as only a few variables are used.
