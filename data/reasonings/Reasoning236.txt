1. Problem summary: Find the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of two given nodes in a binary tree.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Tree traversal, recursion.
3. Step-by-step approach: Recursively search the left and right subtrees for the two nodes. If both nodes are found in different subtrees, the current node is the LCA. If one node is found, return that node. If neither node is found, return null.
4. Edge cases: If the root is null or the root is one of the target nodes, then the root is the LCA.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(N), where N is the number of nodes in the tree. Space complexity is O(H), where H is the height of the tree, due to the recursion stack. In the worst case (skewed tree), H = N, and in the best case (balanced tree), H = log N.
