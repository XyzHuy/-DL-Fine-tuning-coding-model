1. Problem summary: The problem requires finding duplicate files within a file system, given directory information strings. Duplicate files are identified by having the same content. The output should be a list of lists, where each inner list contains the file paths of files with identical content.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Hash Table / String Manipulation. We use a hash table (dictionary) to map file content to a list of file paths.
3. Step-by-step approach: Iterate through each directory path string. Split the string into the directory and file parts. For each file, extract the filename and content. Store the file path in a dictionary, using the content as the key. Finally, filter the dictionary to return only the lists of file paths that have more than one entry (duplicates).
4. Edge cases: Empty input list, no duplicate files, single file in a directory, empty file content. The code handles these cases correctly, returning an empty list if there are no duplicates or the input is empty.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(N*M*K), where N is the number of paths, M is the maximum number of files in a path, and K is the average length of the file content. Space complexity is O(S), where S is the total size of all file contents, used to store the content_to_paths dictionary.
