1. Problem summary: Given a string expression representing a set of words according to a specific grammar, return a sorted list of the distinct words represented by the expression.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: String parsing, Depth-First Search (DFS), Recursion.
3. Step-by-step approach: Use a recursive DFS function to parse the expression. The function finds the innermost curly braces, splits the content inside the braces by commas, and recursively calls itself with the new expressions formed by replacing the brace content with each split part. The base case is when no curly braces are found, then add the resulting string to a set to ensure uniqueness. Finally, sort the set and return it as a list.
4. Edge cases: Empty expression (although the prompt doesn't explicitly allow this, handling it implicitly through the base case of DFS with no '{' or '}' should suffice), nested curly braces, single letters, comma-separated single letters.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is difficult to precisely determine due to the recursive nature and potential for exponential growth based on the input. The space complexity is dominated by the size of the set storing the generated strings, which in the worst case, could also grow exponentially with the length of the expression.
