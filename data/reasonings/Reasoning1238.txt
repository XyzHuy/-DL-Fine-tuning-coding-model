1. Problem summary: Construct a permutation of numbers from 0 to 2^n - 1 where adjacent elements (and the first and last) differ by exactly one bit in their binary representation, and the permutation starts with a given 'start' number.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Gray Codes, Permutations, Bit Manipulation.
3. Step-by-step approach: First, generate the standard n-bit Gray code sequence. The property of Gray codes is that consecutive numbers differ by one bit. Then, find the index of the given 'start' number within this Gray code sequence. Finally, rotate the Gray code sequence so that the 'start' number becomes the first element.
4. Edge cases: The smallest case is n=1, where the sequence is [0,1] or [1,0]. The 'start' value can be 0 or 2^n - 1, which are handled by the general Gray code generation and rotation.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(2^n) due to generating the Gray code and finding the start index. Space complexity is O(2^n) to store the Gray code sequence.
