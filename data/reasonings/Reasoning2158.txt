1. Problem summary: Calculate the amount of newly painted area on each day, given a list of painting intervals, ensuring no area is painted twice.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Segment Tree, Interval Management.
3. Step-by-step approach: Use a segment tree to represent the number line. For each painting interval [start, end], query the segment tree to find the already painted area within this interval. The new area painted is the total length of the interval minus the already painted area. Then, update the segment tree to mark the entire interval as painted.
4. Edge cases: Intervals can overlap. The maximum coordinate value can be up to 5 * 10^4. An empty paint list is not possible by constraints.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(N log M) where N is the number of paint intervals and M is the range of coordinates. Space complexity is O(M) for the segment tree.
