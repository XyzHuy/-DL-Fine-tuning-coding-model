1. Problem summary: Find the earliest closing hour to minimize a penalty based on customer visits ('Y') and non-visits ('N') when the shop is open or closed.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Iterative calculation, greedy approach.
3. Step-by-step approach: Calculate the initial penalty for closing at hour 0. Then, iterate from hour 1 to n (length of customers string). For each hour j, update the penalty by considering the customer status at hour j-1: subtract 1 if a customer was present ('Y') (shop was open and a customer came, so closing now reduces this penalty) or add 1 if no customer was present ('N') (shop was closed and no customer came, so closing now increases this penalty). Keep track of the minimum penalty found and the earliest hour it occurred.
4. Edge cases: The input string can consist of all 'Y's or all 'N's. The shop can close at hour 0 or at hour n.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(n) because we iterate through the customer string once. Space complexity is O(1) as we only use a few variables to store the penalty and best hour.
