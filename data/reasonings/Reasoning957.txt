1. Problem summary: Simulate prison cell state changes over N days, following specific vacancy/occupancy rules based on neighbors.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Simulation, Cycle Detection.
3. Step-by-step approach: Implement the cell state transition rule. Detect repeating patterns in cell states using a dictionary to store seen states and their corresponding day. If a cycle is detected, calculate the remaining days after skipping complete cycles to optimize computation.
4. Edge cases: The first and last cells always have only one neighbor, and their next state depends only on that neighbor. The cycle may start at day 0.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(2^8) in the worst case (all possible states), but cycle detection makes it much faster in practice. Space complexity is O(2^8) to store the seen states.
