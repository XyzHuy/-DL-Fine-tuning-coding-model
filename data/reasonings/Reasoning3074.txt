1. Problem summary: Given a list of apple packs with their respective apple counts and a list of boxes with their capacities, find the minimum number of boxes required to hold all apples. Apples from a single pack can be split across multiple boxes.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Greedy approach, sorting.
3. Step-by-step approach: Calculate the total number of apples. Sort the box capacities in descending order. Iterate through the sorted capacities, accumulating the used capacity. The first time the accumulated capacity meets or exceeds the total apples, return the count of boxes used.
4. Edge cases: The problem statement guarantees that it's always possible to redistribute apples, so no need to handle cases where total apples exceed total capacity. All inputs are within specified constraints.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is dominated by sorting the capacities, which is O(m log m). Space complexity is O(1) if sorting is done in-place, or O(m) if a new sorted list is created.
