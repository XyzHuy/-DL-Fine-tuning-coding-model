1. Problem summary: Find the largest integer in an array that appears exactly once. Return -1 if no such integer exists.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Hash table / Counting
3. Step-by-step approach: Count the frequency of each number using a Counter. Then, filter the numbers that appear only once. Finally, return the maximum of the filtered numbers, or -1 if the filtered list is empty.
4. Edge cases: Empty input list, no unique numbers, multiple unique numbers.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(n), where n is the length of the input array, due to counting and filtering. Space complexity is O(n) in the worst case where all elements are unique, to store the counts in the Counter.
