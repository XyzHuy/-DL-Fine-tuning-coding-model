1. Problem summary: Determine if a reordering of the digits of a given integer n can form a power of 2.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Number theory, permutations, digit manipulation.
3. Step-by-step approach: Generate powers of 2 up to 10^9. For each power of 2 and the input n, calculate the count of each digit. Compare the digit counts of n with each power of 2. If a match is found, return true, otherwise return false.
4. Edge cases: Single-digit numbers, numbers that are already powers of 2, numbers with leading zeros after reordering (handled implicitly by the digit count comparison).
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(log(n)) for generating powers of 2 and O(1) for digit counting and comparison. Space complexity is O(log(n)) to store the digit counts of powers of 2.
