1. Problem summary: Find the even number with the highest frequency in an array, returning the smallest if there's a tie, or -1 if no even numbers exist.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Frequency counting, hash map (Counter), sorting/min function with custom key.
3. Step-by-step approach: First, filter the input array to keep only even numbers. If the filtered list is empty, return -1. Otherwise, use a Counter to store the frequency of each even number. Then, find the number with the maximum frequency, using the number itself as a tie-breaker for the minimum value.
4. Edge cases: The primary edge case is when the input array contains no even numbers. Another consideration is handling ties in frequency correctly by selecting the smallest number.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(N) due to iterating through the array and Counter. Space complexity is O(K) where K is the number of unique even elements, for storing frequencies.
