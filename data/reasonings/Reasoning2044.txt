1. Problem summary: Find the maximum bitwise OR achievable from any subset of a given integer array and count the number of distinct non-empty subsets that produce this maximum OR value.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Bitwise operations, Subset generation, Combinatorics.
3. Step-by-step approach: First, compute the bitwise OR of all elements in the input array to determine the maximum possible OR value. Then, iterate through all possible non-empty subsets of the array, calculate the bitwise OR for each subset, and increment a counter if the subset's OR equals the maximum OR value.
4. Edge cases: The input array could have duplicate numbers. The array length is small (up to 16), allowing for enumeration of subsets. All elements are positive.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(2^N * N) due to iterating through all 2^N subsets and performing OR operations within each subset. Space complexity is O(N) to store the subset, or O(1) if using iterative bit manipulation to represent subsets.
