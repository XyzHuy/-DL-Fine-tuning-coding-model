1. Problem summary: Given an array of 1s, 2s, and 3s, find the minimum operations to make it non-decreasing by removing elements.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Dynamic Programming (DP) on sequences, optimizing subsequences.
3. Step-by-step approach: Maintain three DP states representing the minimum operations to form a non-decreasing subsequence ending with 1, 2, or 3 respectively. Iterate through the array, updating these states based on the current element.
4. Edge cases: An empty array or an array that is already non-decreasing requires zero operations.
5. Time and space complexity: O(n) time because we iterate through the array once, and O(1) space because the DP table size is constant (3 elements).
