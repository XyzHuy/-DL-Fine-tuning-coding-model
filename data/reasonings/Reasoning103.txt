1. Problem summary: Given a binary tree, return a list of lists representing the zigzag level order traversal of its nodes' values.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Tree traversal, Breadth-First Search (BFS).
3. Step-by-step approach: Use BFS to traverse the tree level by level. Maintain a boolean variable to indicate the direction of traversal (left-to-right or right-to-left). Use a deque to store the nodes at each level. Append or prepend node values to the deque based on the current direction. After each level, reverse the direction.
4. Edge cases: Empty tree (root is None).
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(N), where N is the number of nodes in the tree. Space complexity is O(W), where W is the maximum width of the tree (maximum number of nodes at any level).
