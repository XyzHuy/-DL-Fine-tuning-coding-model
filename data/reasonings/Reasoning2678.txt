1. Problem summary: Count passengers older than 60 from a list of passenger detail strings.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: String processing, Iteration.
3. Step-by-step approach: Initialize a counter to zero. Iterate through each passenger's detail string. Extract the two characters representing age. Convert these characters to an integer. If the integer age is greater than 60, increment the counter. Return the final counter.
4. Edge cases: Empty input list (though constraints say length >= 1), ages exactly 60, ages less than 10 (handled by string slicing and integer conversion).
5. Time and space complexity: O(N) time complexity where N is the number of passenger details, as we iterate through each detail once. O(1) space complexity as we only use a few variables regardless of input size.
