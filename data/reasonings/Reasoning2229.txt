1. Problem summary: Determine if an array of integers contains every number within a specific range defined by its minimum value and length.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Array manipulation, Set operations.
3. Step-by-step approach: Find the minimum element and the length of the array. Construct a set of all expected consecutive numbers starting from the minimum. Convert the input array into a set. Compare the two sets for equality.
4. Edge cases: An empty array is not possible due to constraints. Arrays with a single element are always consecutive. Duplicate numbers in the input array will be handled correctly by using sets.
5. Time and space complexity: O(N) time to find the minimum, O(N) to create the set from nums, O(N) to create the expected set, and O(N) for set comparison. Space complexity is O(N) for storing the sets.
