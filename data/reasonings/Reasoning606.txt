1. Problem summary: The problem requires generating a string representation of a binary tree using a preorder traversal, with specific rules for including or omitting parentheses based on the presence of left and right children.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Tree traversal, string manipulation, recursion.
3. Step-by-step approach: Implement a recursive function that performs a preorder traversal. For each node, append its value to the result string. If the node has a left child, recursively process it and enclose the result in parentheses. If the node has no left child but has a right child, append "()" to represent the missing left child. If the node has a right child, recursively process it and enclose the result in parentheses.
4. Edge cases: Empty tree (root is None), nodes with only a left child, nodes with only a right child, nodes with both children.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(N), where N is the number of nodes in the tree, as we visit each node once. Space complexity is O(H), where H is the height of the tree, due to the recursive call stack. In the worst case (skewed tree), H can be N, resulting in O(N) space.
