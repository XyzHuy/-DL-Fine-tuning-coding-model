1. Problem summary: Find the largest subset of a given set of distinct positive integers such that for any two numbers in the subset, one is divisible by the other.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Dynamic Programming
3. Step-by-step approach: First, sort the input array. Then, use dynamic programming to find the length of the largest divisible subset ending at each index. Keep track of the index with the maximum length. Finally, backtrack from that index to construct the largest divisible subset.
4. Edge cases: Empty input array. Array with only one element.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(n^2) due to the nested loops in the dynamic programming step. Space complexity is O(n) to store the dp array and the resulting subset.
