1. Problem summary: Find the maximum number of times a string 'word' can be repeated consecutively to form a substring within 'sequence'.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: String searching, iterative approach.
3. Step-by-step approach: Start with k=0. Repeatedly check if 'word' concatenated k+1 times is a substring of 'sequence'. Increment k as long as this condition is true. The final k is the maximum repeating value.
4. Edge cases: 'word' not present in 'sequence' at all (returns 0), 'sequence' or 'word' length constraints.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(N*M*K) in the worst case where N is sequence length, M is word length, and K is the maximum repeating value. Space complexity is O(M*K) for string concatenation.
