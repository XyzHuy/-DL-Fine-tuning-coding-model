1. Problem summary: Find the maximum bitwise XOR of two numbers in an array that form a "strong pair", where a strong pair (x, y) satisfies |x - y| <= min(x, y).
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Brute-force with optimization, sorting.
3. Step-by-step approach: Sort the input array. Iterate through all possible pairs (i, j) where i <= j. For each pair (nums[i], nums[j]), check if it's a strong pair. If it is, update the maximum XOR found so far. Optimization: since the array is sorted, if |nums[i] - nums[j]| > min(nums[i], nums[j]), further pairs with nums[i] will also fail the condition, so break the inner loop.
4. Edge cases: Array with one element (strong pair is the element with itself, XOR is 0). All elements are the same (XOR is 0). No strong pairs besides self-pairs.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(N^2) due to nested loops, with sorting taking O(N log N). Space complexity is O(1) if sorting is in-place, or O(N) depending on sort implementation.
