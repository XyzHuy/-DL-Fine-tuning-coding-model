1. Problem summary: Determine if a binary string has at most one contiguous segment of '1's.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: String manipulation, pattern detection.
3. Step-by-step approach: Check if the substring "01" exists within the input string. If "01" is found, it implies a break in a single contiguous segment of ones, indicating more than one segment.
4. Edge cases: The problem statement guarantees the string is non-empty, starts with '1', and contains only '0's and '1's, so simpler cases like empty string or leading zeros are avoided.
5. Time and space complexity: O(N) time complexity due to substring search, and O(1) space complexity.
