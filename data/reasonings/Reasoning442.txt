1. Problem summary: Find all integers that appear twice in an array of integers where each integer is between 1 and n and appears at most twice.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Array manipulation, in-place modification.
3. Step-by-step approach: Rearrange the array such that nums[i] = i + 1. Iterate through the array. If nums[i] != nums[nums[i] - 1], swap them. After rearranging, iterate through the array and add any number nums[i] such that nums[i] != i + 1 to the result list.
4. Edge cases: Empty array, array with only one element, array with no duplicates, array with all elements being duplicates.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(n) because each number is swapped at most a constant number of times. Space complexity is O(1) excluding the output array.
