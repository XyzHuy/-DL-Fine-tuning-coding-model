1. Problem summary: Maximize the total score by applying k operations. Each operation adds the chosen number to the score and replaces it with its value ceiling-divided by 3.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Greedy algorithm using a max-heap.
3. Step-by-step approach: Repeatedly select the largest number from the current set, add it to the score, and update it by replacing it with ceil(number/3), then re-insert it. Use a max-heap to efficiently find the largest number in each step.
4. Edge cases: k can be larger than the number of distinct elements. Numbers can become 0 or 1 after division.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(k log n) due to k heap operations, and space complexity is O(n) for the heap.
