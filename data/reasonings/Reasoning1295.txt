1. Problem summary: Count how many numbers in a given array have an even number of digits.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Iteration and String Manipulation.
3. Step-by-step approach: Iterate through each number, convert it to a string to find its length (number of digits), and check if the length is even. Increment a counter if it is.
4. Edge cases: Numbers with single digits, and numbers up to 10^5 which have at most 6 digits. The input array will not be empty.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(N*D) where N is the number of elements and D is the maximum number of digits in any number. Space complexity is O(D) for string conversion.
