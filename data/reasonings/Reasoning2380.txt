1. Problem summary: Repeatedly replace all "01" substrings with "10" until no "01" substrings remain, and count the number of replacements.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: String manipulation, simulation.
3. Step-by-step approach: Initialize a counter for seconds to zero. While the string contains "01", perform a global replacement of "01" with "10" and increment the seconds counter. Return the final seconds count.
4. Edge cases: If the input string initially has no "01" substrings, the loop condition will be false, and 0 seconds will be returned, which is correct.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(n*k) where k is the number of seconds, due to repeated string replacements. Space complexity is O(n) for string manipulations.
