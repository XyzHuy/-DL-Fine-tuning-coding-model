1. Problem summary: Sort a string based on the frequency of characters in decreasing order.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: String manipulation, sorting, hashmap (Counter).
3. Step-by-step approach: Count character frequencies, sort characters by frequency, and build the result string.
4. Edge cases: Empty string, string with all unique characters, string with all same characters.
5. Time and space complexity: Time: O(n log n) due to sorting. Space: O(n) for storing the frequency map and result.
