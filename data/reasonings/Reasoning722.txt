1. Problem summary: The problem asks to remove C++ style comments (both single-line "//" and multi-line "/* */") from a given source code represented as a list of strings, where each string is a line of code. The result should be a list of strings representing the source code with comments removed, ensuring no empty lines are included in the output.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: String manipulation, parsing.
3. Step-by-step approach: Iterate through each line of the source code. Maintain a boolean flag `in_block_comment` to track whether we are currently inside a block comment. For each character in a line, check for the start and end of block comments or the start of a line comment. If inside a block comment, look for the end of the block comment. If not inside a block comment, look for the start of a block comment or a line comment. If a line comment is encountered, ignore the rest of the line. Build a buffer for characters that are not part of comments. Append the buffer to the result list after processing each line if it's not empty and not currently in a block comment, and clear the buffer for the next line.
4. Edge cases: Nested comments (which are invalid), empty lines after comment removal, handling the transition from being in a block comment to not being in one, overlapping comment delimiters (e.g., "/*/*/").
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(N), where N is the total number of characters in the source code, as each character is visited at most once. Space complexity is O(M), where M is the total number of characters in the result, since we store the comment-free code in a buffer and eventually in the result list.
