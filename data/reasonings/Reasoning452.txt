1. Problem summary: Given a set of balloons represented by their start and end x-coordinates, find the minimum number of arrows needed to burst all balloons. An arrow shot at x bursts all balloons whose x-range includes x.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Greedy algorithm, Interval Scheduling (or Interval Covering) problem.
3. Step-by-step approach: Sort the balloons based on their end coordinates. Iterate through the sorted balloons. If a balloon's start coordinate is greater than the position of the last arrow, increment the arrow count and update the last arrow position to the end coordinate of the current balloon.
4. Edge cases: Empty input list, balloons with overlapping ranges, balloons with non-overlapping ranges.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(n log n) due to sorting, and space complexity is O(1) as we only use a few extra variables.
