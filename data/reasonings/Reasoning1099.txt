1. Problem summary: Find the maximum sum of two numbers in an array that is less than a given value k.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Two Pointers / Sorting
3. Step-by-step approach: Sort the array, then use two pointers, one at the beginning and one at the end. If the sum of the two pointers is less than k, update the maximum sum and move the left pointer to the right. Otherwise, move the right pointer to the left.
4. Edge cases: If no such pair exists, return -1. Empty array or array with only one element.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(n log n) due to sorting. Space complexity is O(1) as sorting is done in place.
