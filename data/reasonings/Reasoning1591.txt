1. Problem summary: The problem asks if a given target grid of colors can be printed using a special printer that prints solid rectangular blocks of a single color, and each color can only be used once.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Graph theory, specifically topological sort. The problem can be modeled as a directed acyclic graph (DAG) where nodes are colors and edges represent dependencies.
3. Step-by-step approach: First, determine the bounding box for each color. Then, build a dependency graph where an edge from color A to color B means color A must be printed before color B (because B is covered by A). Finally, perform a topological sort. If a cycle is detected or a color cannot be printed due to underlying different colors, return false.
4. Edge cases: Grids with only one color, grids where colors perfectly tile without overlap, grids where a single color must cover another color.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(C^2 * M * N) where C is the number of distinct colors, M is rows, N is columns, due to graph construction and checking. Space complexity is O(C^2 + M * N) for storing the graph, color bounds, and the modified grid.
