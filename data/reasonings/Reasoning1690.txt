1. Problem summary: Players take turns removing stones from either end of a row, scoring the sum of remaining stones. Alice maximizes her score difference, Bob minimizes it.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Dynamic programming, game theory.
3. Step-by-step approach: Calculate prefix sums. Use a DP table where dp[i][j] stores the maximum score difference achievable for stones from index i to j. For each subarray, consider taking the left or right stone. The score for taking a stone is the sum of remaining stones minus the optimal score difference the opponent would achieve in the reduced subarray.
4. Edge cases: The game ends when no stones are left. The minimum number of stones is 2.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(n^2) due to the nested loops filling the DP table. Space complexity is O(n^2) for the DP table and O(n) for prefix sums, resulting in O(n^2).
