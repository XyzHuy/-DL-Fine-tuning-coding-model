1. Problem summary: Reorder an integer array such that nums[0] < nums[1] > nums[2] < nums[3]....
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Array manipulation, sorting.
3. Step-by-step approach: Sort the array, divide it into two halves, reverse each half, and then interleave the elements from the two halves back into the original array.
4. Edge cases: Empty array, array with one element, array with duplicate elements.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(n log n) due to sorting. Space complexity is O(n) because of the auxiliary arrays for storing halves.
