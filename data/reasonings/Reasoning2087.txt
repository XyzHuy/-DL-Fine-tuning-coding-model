1. Problem summary: Calculate the minimum cost for a robot to move from a starting cell to a home cell in a grid, where costs depend on the row or column entered.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Greedy, Dynamic Programming (though a greedy approach is sufficient here).
3. Step-by-step approach: Calculate the cost for row movements independently of column movements. Sum costs for rows between start row and home row. Sum costs for columns between start column and home column. The total cost is the sum of these row and column costs.
4. Edge cases: The robot is already at its home position, resulting in zero cost.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(m+n) due to summing row and column costs. Space complexity is O(1) as only a few variables are used.
