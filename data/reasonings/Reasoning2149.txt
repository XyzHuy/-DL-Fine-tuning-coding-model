1. Problem summary: Rearrange an array of equal positive and negative integers so that consecutive elements have opposite signs, positive numbers come first, and relative order within signs is maintained.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Array manipulation, two pointers.
3. Step-by-step approach: Create a new array. Iterate through the input array. Place positive numbers at even indices and negative numbers at odd indices of the new array, advancing the respective index by two after each placement.
4. Edge cases: The problem guarantees an even length array with an equal number of positive and negative integers, starting with a positive. Thus, no specific edge cases like empty arrays or unequal counts need explicit handling beyond the general logic.
5. Time and space complexity: O(N) time complexity due to a single pass through the input array. O(N) space complexity for the auxiliary output array.
