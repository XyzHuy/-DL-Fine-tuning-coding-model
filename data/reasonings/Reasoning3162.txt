1. Problem summary: Given two arrays nums1 and nums2 and an integer k, find the number of pairs (i, j) such that nums1[i] is divisible by nums2[j] * k.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Brute Force, Iteration.
3. Step-by-step approach: Iterate through each element in nums1. For each element in nums1, iterate through each element in nums2. Check if the current element from nums1 is divisible by the product of the current element from nums2 and k. If it is, increment a counter.
4. Edge cases: Arrays can be empty, k can be 1, numbers in arrays can be small or large within the constraints. The provided constraints ensure that n, m, k, and array elements are positive integers, so no division by zero or empty array issues based on constraints.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(n*m) due to nested loops. Space complexity is O(1) as only a counter variable is used.
