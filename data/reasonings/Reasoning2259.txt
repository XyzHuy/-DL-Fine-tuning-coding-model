1. Problem summary: Remove one instance of a given digit from a number string to maximize the resulting number's decimal value.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: String manipulation, brute force iteration.
3. Step-by-step approach: Iterate through the number string, identify occurrences of the target digit. For each occurrence, form a new string by removing that digit. Compare this new string with the current maximum, updating if the new one is larger.
4. Edge cases: The digit is guaranteed to exist. The number can have leading zeros conceptually if we were dealing with actual numbers, but here we are comparing strings lexicographically.
5. Time and space complexity: Time O(N^2) due to string slicing within the loop, space O(N) to store the new strings.
