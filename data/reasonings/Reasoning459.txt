1. Problem summary: Determine if a string can be formed by repeating a substring of itself.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: String manipulation/pattern finding.
3. Step-by-step approach: Concatenate the string with itself, remove the first and last characters, and check if the original string exists within this modified string.
4. Edge cases: Empty string (not applicable based on constraints), single character string, string that is already a repeating pattern, string that is not a repeating pattern.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(n) due to string concatenation and the `in` operator. Space complexity is O(n) because of the concatenated string.
