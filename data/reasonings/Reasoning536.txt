1. Problem summary: Given a string representation of a binary tree, construct the corresponding binary tree. The string consists of an integer root value followed by optional left and right subtrees enclosed in parentheses.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Tree construction / Recursion
3. Step-by-step approach: Parse the root value, then recursively construct the left and right subtrees based on the parenthesis structure. The base case is an empty string, which returns None, or when there are no parenthesis.
4. Edge cases: Empty input string, negative root values, no child nodes, only left or right child.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(N), where N is the length of the string, due to traversing the string once. Space complexity is O(H), where H is the height of the tree, due to the recursion depth. In the worst case, where the tree is skewed, H can be N, leading to O(N) space complexity.
