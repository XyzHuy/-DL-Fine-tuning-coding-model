1. Problem summary: Given equations of variable pairs and their values, and a set of queries of variable pairs, return the value of each query if it can be determined, otherwise return -1.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Graph, Union Find
3. Step-by-step approach: Use Union Find to build a graph where nodes are variables and edges represent the division relationship. Find the connected components, and for each query, check if the two variables are in the same component. If they are, calculate the value; otherwise, return -1.
4. Edge cases: Variables not in the equations, division by zero (though the problem statement says it won't happen), and variables are not in the same connected component.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(E + Q), where E is the number of equations and Q is the number of queries. Space complexity is O(V), where V is the number of unique variables.
