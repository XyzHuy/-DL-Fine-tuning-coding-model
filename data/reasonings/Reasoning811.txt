1. Problem summary: Given a list of count-paired domains, the task is to return the counts of each domain and subdomain present in the input.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: String manipulation, hash map (defaultdict).
3. Step-by-step approach: Iterate through the input list, split each entry into count and domain, split the domain into subdomains, and then iterate through the subdomains, adding the count to each subdomain's entry in a hash map. Finally, format the output based on the counts and domains in the hash map.
4. Edge cases: Empty input list, single domain with no subdomains, large counts.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(N*M), where N is the number of domains and M is the maximum number of subdomains in a domain. Space complexity is O(N*M) due to storing the counts of each domain and subdomain in a hash map.
