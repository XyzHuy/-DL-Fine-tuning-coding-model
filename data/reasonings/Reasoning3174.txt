1. Problem summary: Remove all digits from a string by repeatedly deleting the first digit encountered and its closest preceding non-digit character until no digits remain.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: String manipulation, simulation.
3. Step-by-step approach: Iterate through the string. If a digit is found, remove both the digit and the character immediately before it. Adjust the iteration index to account for the removal. If a non-digit is found, simply move to the next character.
4. Edge cases: The string may contain no digits initially. The problem guarantees that all digits can be deleted.
5. Time and space complexity: O(N^2) time due to repeated list deletions, O(N) space for the list representation.
