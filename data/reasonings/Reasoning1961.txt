1. Problem summary: Check if a given string 's' can be formed by concatenating the first 'k' strings from a list 'words', where 'k' is a positive integer up to the length of 'words'.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: String manipulation, Greedy.
3. Step-by-step approach: Iterate through the 'words' array, accumulating the strings into a 'concatenated' string. After each accumulation, check if the 'concatenated' string is equal to 's'. If it is, return true. If the length of 'concatenated' exceeds the length of 's' at any point, it's impossible to form 's', so return false.
4. Edge cases: An empty 'words' list (though constraints prevent this), 's' being empty, 's' being exactly one of the words, 's' being longer than the total possible concatenation.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(N*L), where N is the number of words and L is the average length of words, due to string concatenation. Space complexity is O(L_s), where L_s is the length of s, for storing the concatenated string.
