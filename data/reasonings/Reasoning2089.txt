1. Problem summary: Find all indices of a target value in an array after it has been sorted.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Array manipulation, Sorting.
3. Step-by-step approach: First, sort the input array in non-decreasing order. Then, iterate through the sorted array and collect the indices where the element matches the target value.
4. Edge cases: The target may not exist in the array, in which case an empty list should be returned. The input array could be empty or contain only one element.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is dominated by sorting, O(N log N), where N is the length of nums. Space complexity is O(N) for storing the result, or O(1) if we consider the output space as not contributing to complexity, and O(log N) or O(N) for sorting depending on implementation.
