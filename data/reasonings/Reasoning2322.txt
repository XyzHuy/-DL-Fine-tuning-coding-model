1. Problem summary: Given a tree with node values, find the minimum score by removing two distinct edges to form three connected components. The score is the difference between the largest and smallest XOR sum of node values in the three components.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Tree traversal, XOR properties, brute force with optimization.
3. Step-by-step approach: Iterate through all possible pairs of distinct edges to remove. For each pair, identify the three resulting components. Calculate the XOR sum of node values for each component. Determine the score as the difference between the maximum and minimum XOR sum. Keep track of the minimum score found. Optimization: For each first edge removal, identify subtrees and their XOR sums. Then, for each second edge removal within a specific subtree, calculate the XOR sums of the three components efficiently.
4. Edge cases: A tree with a minimum of 3 nodes. Node values can be large.
5. Time and space complexity: The time complexity is dominated by iterating through pairs of edges and performing DFS traversals, approximately O(N^2 * N) or O(N^3) without optimizations, which is reduced to O(N^2) with efficient XOR sum calculation for subtrees. Space complexity is O(N) for storing the graph and recursion stack.
