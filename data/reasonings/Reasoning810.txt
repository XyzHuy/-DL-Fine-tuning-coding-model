1. Problem summary: Determine if Alice wins a game where players alternately remove numbers from a chalkboard, losing if the XOR of the remaining numbers is 0 after their move.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Game theory, bitwise operations (XOR).
3. Step-by-step approach: Calculate the XOR sum of all numbers. If the XOR sum is initially 0, Alice wins. Otherwise, Alice wins if the number of elements is even.
4. Edge cases: Empty input array is not possible based on the constraints. Initial XOR is zero.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(n) to compute the initial XOR. Space complexity is O(1).
