1. Problem summary: Find the maximum frequency of any substring that has at most maxLetters unique characters and a length between minSize and maxSize.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: String manipulation, frequency counting, sliding window.
3. Step-by-step approach: Iterate through all possible substrings of length minSize. For each substring, check if it meets the maxLetters constraint. If it does, increment its count in a frequency map. The maximum value in the frequency map is the answer. Substrings larger than minSize but within maxSize will implicitly be covered by valid minSize substrings they contain.
4. Edge cases: Empty string (not possible due to constraints), string length less than minSize, no substrings meeting criteria.
5. Time and space complexity: O(N * K) time where N is string length and K is minSize for substring extraction and set creation, O(N) space for the counter.
