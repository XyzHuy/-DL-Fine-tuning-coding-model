1. Problem summary: Find the minimum length of a string after repeatedly removing "AB" or "CD" substrings.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: String manipulation, Stack-based processing.
3. Step-by-step approach: Iterate through the string, maintaining a stack. If the current character forms "AB" or "CD" with the top of the stack, pop the stack; otherwise, push the current character. The final stack length is the answer.
4. Edge cases: Empty string (though constraints say length >= 1), string with no removable substrings, string that becomes empty after removals.
5. Time and space complexity: O(N) time complexity due to single pass through the string, O(N) space complexity for the stack in the worst case.
