1. Problem summary: Minimize operations to make each cell equal to the cell below it and different from the cell to its right in a given grid.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Dynamic Programming.
3. Step-by-step approach: Use DP where dp[j][num] represents the minimum operations for column j and all columns to its right, with column j having all its cells equal to `num`. Iterate from the last column backwards, calculating dp[j][num] based on the minimum of dp[j+1][k] (where k is not equal to num) plus the cost of changing column j to `num`.
4. Edge cases: Grids with a single column (m=1) or a single row (n=1).
5. Time and space complexity: O(m * n * k^2) time and O(n * k) space, where k is the number of possible values (10 in this case).
