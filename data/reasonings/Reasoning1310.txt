1. Problem summary: Given an array of positive integers and several range queries, compute the XOR sum of elements within each specified range.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Prefix sums (specifically, prefix XOR).
3. Step-by-step approach: Calculate a prefix XOR array where each element stores the XOR sum from the start of the original array up to that index. For each query [left, right], the XOR sum of the range can be found by XORing the prefix XOR at 'right' with the prefix XOR at 'left-1'. If 'left' is 0, the answer is simply the prefix XOR at 'right'.
4. Edge cases: The query range can start at index 0.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(N + Q) where N is the length of arr and Q is the number of queries. Space complexity is O(N) for the prefix XOR array.
