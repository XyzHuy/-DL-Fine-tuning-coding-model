1. Problem summary: Check if a given string `s` is formed by concatenating the first character of each string in a list `words`.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: String manipulation, comparison.
3. Step-by-step approach: Iterate through the `words` list, extract the first character of each word, concatenate these characters to form a potential acronym, and finally compare this constructed acronym with the input string `s`.
4. Edge cases: The lengths of `words` and `s` might not match, or individual words in `words` might be empty (though constraints state they have length at least 1).
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(N*L) where N is the number of words and L is the average length of words for string concatenation, or O(N) if optimized. Space complexity is O(N) for storing the constructed acronym string.
