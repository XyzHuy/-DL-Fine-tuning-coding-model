1. Problem summary: Count pairs (i, j) where nums1[i] is divisible by nums2[j] * k.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Brute force with optimization.
3. Step-by-step approach: Iterate through each number in nums1. For each number, iterate through the unique numbers in nums2 and their counts. If nums1[i] is divisible by (nums2[j] * k), add the count of nums2[j] to the total good pairs.
4. Edge cases: Empty arrays (although constraints prevent this), k=1, large input values.
5. Time and space complexity: Time O(n * m) in worst case, O(n * unique_m) with Counter optimization, Space O(m) for Counter.
