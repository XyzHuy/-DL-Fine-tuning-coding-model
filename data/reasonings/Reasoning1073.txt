1. Problem summary: Given two arrays representing numbers in base -2, find their sum, and return the result in base -2 array format.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Number conversion (base -2 to decimal and vice-versa), arithmetic.
3. Step-by-step approach: Convert both input arrays to decimal numbers, add them together, and convert the resulting decimal sum back to a base -2 array.
4. Edge cases: Handle the case where the sum is zero; ensure the base -2 conversion handles negative remainders correctly during division by -2.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(N+M) where N and M are the lengths of the input arrays because of the conversion to decimal and back. Space complexity is O(N+M) for storing the converted array and the result array.
