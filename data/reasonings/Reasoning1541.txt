1. Problem summary: The problem asks for the minimum number of insertions of '(' or ')' characters needed to make a given parentheses string balanced, where '(' requires two consecutive '))' to be balanced.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: This is a string manipulation and greedy problem.
3. Step-by-step approach: Iterate through the string, maintaining a balance counter for open parentheses. When an opening parenthesis '(' is encountered, increment the balance. When a closing parenthesis ')' is encountered, first check if there's an open parenthesis to match. If not, an insertion of '(' is needed. Then, check if there's a second consecutive ')'. If not, an insertion of ')' is needed. After iterating, any remaining balance requires two insertions of ')' for each open parenthesis.
4. Edge cases: The string might start with closing parentheses, contain only opening parentheses, or only closing parentheses. An empty string is not possible based on constraints.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(N) because we iterate through the string once. Space complexity is O(1) as we only use a few variables.
