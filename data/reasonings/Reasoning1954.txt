1. Problem summary: Find the minimum perimeter of a square plot centered at (0,0) that encloses at least a given number of apples, where apples at (i,j) are |i| + |j|.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Iterative search, Mathematical calculation, Optimization.
3. Step-by-step approach: Start with k=0 and iteratively increase k. In each iteration, calculate the total apples within a square of side 2k (which corresponds to extending the perimeter by 2 units in each direction from the previous square). The number of apples in the k-th layer is 12*k*k. Sum these up until the total apples reach or exceed neededApples. The perimeter will be 4 * (2k).
4. Edge cases: The minimum value of neededApples is 1. The constraints on neededApples are up to 10^15, which means k could grow significantly.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(k) where k is the maximum layer needed, which is roughly proportional to the cube root of neededApples. Space complexity is O(1).
