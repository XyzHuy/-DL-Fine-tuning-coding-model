1. Problem summary: Determine if swapping one character from word1 with one character from word2 can make the number of distinct characters in both strings equal.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: String manipulation, frequency counting, combinatorics.
3. Step-by-step approach: Count character frequencies in both strings. Iterate through all possible pairs of characters (one from word1's distinct set, one from word2's distinct set) to simulate a swap. After each simulated swap, check if the distinct character counts are equal. If a match is found, return true. If no match after checking all pairs, return false.
4. Edge cases: Strings with only one distinct character, strings with no common characters, strings that are already equal in distinct character counts.
5. Time and space complexity: O(A^2), where A is the size of the alphabet (26), for iterating through potential swaps. Space complexity is O(A) for storing character counts and distinct character sets.
