1. Problem summary: Find the minimum side jumps for a frog to travel from point 0, lane 2, to point n, across 3 lanes, avoiding obstacles.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Dynamic Programming.
3. Step-by-step approach: Maintain a DP array representing minimum side jumps to reach each lane at the current point. Iterate through points, updating DP considering direct moves and side jumps if no obstacle exists.
4. Edge cases: Obstacles at a point, starting at point 0, ending at point n, and no obstacles.
5. Time and space complexity: Time O(n), Space O(1).
