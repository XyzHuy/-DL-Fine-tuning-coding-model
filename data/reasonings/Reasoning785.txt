1. Problem summary: Determine if a given undirected graph is bipartite.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Graph traversal, Depth-First Search (DFS), Bipartite graph checking.
3. Step-by-step approach: Use DFS to color the graph nodes with two colors (1 and -1). If a conflict arises (adjacent nodes have the same color), the graph is not bipartite. Iterate through all nodes, and if a node hasn't been colored yet, start a new DFS from that node.
4. Edge cases: Empty graph (or a graph with no edges), disconnected graph. Need to handle the case where the graph is disconnected by iterating through all nodes.
5. Time and space complexity: Time: O(V+E), where V is the number of vertices and E is the number of edges. Space: O(V) for the color array and the recursion stack in DFS.
