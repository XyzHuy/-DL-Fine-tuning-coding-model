1. Problem summary: Determine if all integers within a given inclusive range [left, right] are covered by at least one interval in a list of intervals.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Interval coverage, Set manipulation.
3. Step-by-step approach: Collect all unique integers covered by any interval into a set, then iterate from left to right, checking if each integer exists in the set.
4. Edge cases: The range [left, right] might be empty or contain a single element. Intervals might overlap or be disjoint. The maximum values for intervals and the range are small (50).
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(N*M + R) where N is number of ranges, M is max range length, and R is the length of [left, right]. Space complexity is O(M) for the set.
