1. Problem summary: Minimize the cost of swapping elements in nums1 to ensure no element at any index matches the element at the same index in nums2.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Greedy algorithm, combinatorial optimization.
3. Step-by-step approach: First, identify all indices where nums1[i] == nums2[i]. Add these indices to the total cost. Then, analyze the values at these conflicting indices. If a value appears too frequently (more than half the conflicting indices), additional swaps are needed. Find suitable indices outside the initial conflicting set to swap with, prioritizing those that introduce the least additional cost. If not enough suitable indices are found, it's impossible.
4. Edge cases: If there are no initial conflicts (nums1[i] != nums2[i] for all i), the cost is 0. If it's impossible to resolve all conflicts, return -1.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(N) due to iterating through the arrays. Space complexity is O(N) in the worst case for storing conflicting indices and value counts.
