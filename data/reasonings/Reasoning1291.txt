1. Problem summary: Find all integers within a given range [low, high] that have digits that increase by exactly one sequentially.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Number generation, brute-force generation with filtering.
3. Step-by-step approach: Iterate through all possible starting digits (1-9) and lengths, constructing sequential numbers. Add numbers to a list if they are less than or equal to high. Finally, filter this list to include only numbers greater than or equal to low and sort the result.
4. Edge cases: The input range [low, high] can include numbers of varying lengths. The maximum value of high is 10^9.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(1) because the number of possible sequential digit numbers is finite and small (at most 9*9 = 81 numbers to generate). Space complexity is O(1) for the same reason, as the storage for the generated numbers is constant.
