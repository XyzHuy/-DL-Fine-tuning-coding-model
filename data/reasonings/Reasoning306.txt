1. Problem summary: Determine if a string of digits can form an additive sequence, where each number (after the first two) is the sum of the preceding two.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: String manipulation, backtracking, recursion.
3. Step-by-step approach: Iterate through possible lengths for the first and second numbers in the sequence. Check for leading zeros and recursively verify if the remaining string can form a valid additive sequence based on the sum of the previous two numbers.
4. Edge cases: Leading zeros in numbers within the sequence, ensuring at least three numbers are in the sequence.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is roughly O(n^3) due to nested loops and recursion potentially exploring many branches. Space complexity is O(n) due to recursion depth in worst case scenarios, and string slicing.
