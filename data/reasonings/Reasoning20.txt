1. Problem summary: Determine if a string containing parentheses is valid, meaning all opening brackets are closed by the same type of bracket in the correct order.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Stack-based approach for parenthesis matching.
3. Step-by-step approach: Iterate through the string. If an opening bracket is encountered, push it onto the stack. If a closing bracket is encountered, pop from the stack and check if the popped element matches the corresponding opening bracket. If the stack is empty at the end, the string is valid.
4. Edge cases: Empty string, string with only opening or closing brackets, mismatched brackets.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(n) because we iterate through the string once. Space complexity is O(n) in the worst case where the string contains only opening brackets.
