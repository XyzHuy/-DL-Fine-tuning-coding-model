1. Problem summary: Alice and Bob play a game with multiple piles of stones, taking turns removing stones from a single pile. The player who cannot make a move loses. Alice starts first.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Game Theory, specifically impartial games solvable by the Sprague-Grundy theorem, often referred to as Nim game.
3. Step-by-step approach: Calculate the bitwise XOR sum (Nim-sum) of the number of stones in each pile. If the Nim-sum is non-zero, the first player (Alice) has a winning strategy. If the Nim-sum is zero, the second player (Bob) has a winning strategy.
4. Edge cases: The problem constraints are small (n and pile sizes up to 7), but the logic holds for larger inputs. An empty set of piles would mean the first player loses immediately (Nim-sum 0).
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(n) to iterate through the piles. Space complexity is O(1) as only a single variable is used to store the Nim-sum.
