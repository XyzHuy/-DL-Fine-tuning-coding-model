1. Problem summary: Make an array beautiful by ensuring all subarrays of size 3 or more have a maximum element >= k, minimizing total increment operations.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Dynamic Programming.
3. Step-by-step approach: Use DP where dp[i] represents the minimum operations for the prefix nums[0...i] to be beautiful. The base cases are for the first three elements. For subsequent elements dp[i] is the minimum of dp[i-1], dp[i-2], dp[i-3] plus the operations to make nums[i] at least k. The final answer is the minimum of dp[n-1], dp[n-2], dp[n-3].
4. Edge cases: Array length is at least 3. k can be 0. Numbers in nums can be large. Initial values in nums might already be >= k.
5. Time and space complexity: O(n) time complexity due to a single pass through the array. O(n) space complexity for the DP table.
