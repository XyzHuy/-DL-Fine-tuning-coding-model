1. Problem summary: Find the length of the longest repeating substring in a given string.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: String manipulation, binary search.
3. Step-by-step approach: Use binary search to find the length of the longest repeating substring. The `is_repeated_substring_of_length` function checks if there exists a repeating substring of a given length by iterating through all possible substrings of that length and using a set to track seen substrings. If a substring is already in the set, it is repeated, and the function returns True.
4. Edge cases: Empty string (handled implicitly, returns 0), string with no repeating substrings.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(N log N), where N is the length of the string, due to the binary search and the O(N) complexity of the `is_repeated_substring_of_length` function. Space complexity is O(N) in the worst case, where the `seen` set stores all possible substrings.
