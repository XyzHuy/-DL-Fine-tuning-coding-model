1. Problem summary: Find the minimum cost path from any cell in the first row to any cell in the last row of a grid, considering cell values and movement costs between rows.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Dynamic Programming.
3. Step-by-step approach: Initialize a DP table. Set the first row of the DP table with the grid cell values. Iterate from the second row to the last row. For each cell in the current row, calculate the minimum cost to reach it from any cell in the previous row by considering all possible moves and their associated costs, plus the current cell's value. The final answer is the minimum value in the last row of the DP table.
4. Edge cases: The grid dimensions (m, n) are at least 2x2. Distinct integers from 0 to m*n-1 are present. Costs are positive.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(m * n * n) due to three nested loops. Space complexity is O(m * n) for the DP table.
