1. Problem summary: Determine if a given array `nums` is the only shortest supersequence constructible from a list of subsequences `sequences`.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Topological sort, graph problem.
3. Step-by-step approach: Construct a graph where edges represent the order of elements in the subsequences. Perform topological sort. If at any point the queue has more than one element, it means there's more than one possible order, thus `nums` is not the only possible supersequence. Also, the graph must be fully reconstructable from the given sequences.
4. Edge cases: Empty sequences, sequences with single elements, duplicate elements within sequences (although constraints say sequences are unique), `nums` not constructible from `sequences`.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(Sum of sequence lengths + n), where n is the length of nums. Space complexity is O(n) for the graph and indegree array.
