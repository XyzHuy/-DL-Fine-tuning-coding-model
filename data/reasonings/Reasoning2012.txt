1. Problem summary: Calculate the sum of "beauties" for elements in a given array `nums` at indices from 1 to `nums.length - 2`. Beauty is determined by comparisons with elements to the left and right.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Array manipulation, Precomputation, Sliding Window concept.
3. Step-by-step approach: Precompute the maximum value to the left of each index and the minimum value to the right of each index. Then, iterate through the array from index 1 to `n-2` and check the conditions for beauty 2 and beauty 1. Sum up the beauties.
4. Edge cases: The problem statement guarantees `nums.length >= 3`, so no need to handle arrays smaller than this. The conditions inherently exclude the first and last elements from beauty calculation.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(N) due to three linear passes over the array. Space complexity is O(N) to store the precomputed `left_max` and `right_min` arrays.
