1. Problem summary: Count the number of rods (0-9) that have at least one red, one green, and one blue ring.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Hash Map / Frequency Counting.
3. Step-by-step approach: Iterate through the input string, parsing color-rod pairs. For each rod, maintain a set of colors present. Finally, count how many rods have all three colors in their set.
4. Edge cases: Input string representing less than 3 rings, or cases where a rod has duplicate colors but not all three distinct colors.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(N) where N is the length of the input string, as we iterate through it once. Space complexity is O(1) because the number of rods is fixed at 10, and the set for each rod can hold at most 3 colors.
