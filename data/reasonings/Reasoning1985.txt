1. Problem summary: Find the k-th largest integer from a list of strings, where integers are compared by their numerical value.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Sorting, comparison of large numbers represented as strings.
3. Step-by-step approach: Convert each string to its integer representation for comparison purposes, sort the list of strings based on these integer values in descending order, and then return the element at the k-1 index.
4. Edge cases: All numbers are represented as strings, potential for very large numbers exceeding standard integer types, duplicates are treated as distinct entities.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is dominated by sorting, O(N log N * L) where N is the number of strings and L is the maximum length of a string for comparison. Space complexity is O(N * L) to store the sorted list.
