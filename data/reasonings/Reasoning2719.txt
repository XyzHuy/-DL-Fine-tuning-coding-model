1. Problem summary: Count numbers within a given range [num1, num2] whose digit sum falls within [min_sum, max_sum].
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Digit DP (Dynamic Programming on digits).
3. Step-by-step approach: Calculate the count of good numbers up to num2 and subtract the count of good numbers up to num1-1. The core logic uses DFS with memoization to count numbers up to a given string representation, considering tightness constraints and digit sum.
4. Edge cases: Handling num1 being "0" or "1" requires careful subtraction. The modulo operation is crucial to prevent overflow.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(length_of_num * max_sum * 2), and space complexity is O(length_of_num * max_sum * 2) for the DP table.
