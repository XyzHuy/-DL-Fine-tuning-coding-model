1. Problem summary: Minimize flips in a binary matrix to make all rows and columns palindromic, and the total count of 1s divisible by 4.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Greedy, Mathematical Logic, Palindrome properties.
3. Step-by-step approach: Iterate from the outer layers inwards, flipping cells to satisfy palindrome conditions for each group of four symmetric cells. Handle the center row/column if dimensions are odd. Finally, adjust flips to meet the divisibility by 4 condition for the total count of 1s.
4. Edge cases: Odd dimensions for rows and/or columns, leading to a single center cell or center row/column.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(m*n) due to iterating through the grid cells. Space complexity is O(1) as only a few variables are used.
