1. Problem summary: Determine if a binary array 'derived' can be formed from an unknown binary array 'original' using XOR operations on adjacent elements, including a wrap-around XOR.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Array manipulation, Bitwise operations, Backtracking (implicitly handled by constraint checking).
3. Step-by-step approach: Assume original[0] is 0 and derive the rest of the 'original' array using the given formulas. Then, verify if the last derived condition (original[n-1] XOR original[0] == derived[n-1]) holds true. If it does, a valid 'original' array exists.
4. Edge cases: The array length n is at least 1. All derived elements are 0 or 1. The check for n=1 is implicitly handled by the loop structure and the final condition.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(n) because we iterate through the derived array once to construct and check the original array. Space complexity is O(n) to store the reconstructed original array.
