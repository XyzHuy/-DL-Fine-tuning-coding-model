1. Problem summary: Identify and return a list of invalid transactions from a given list of transactions based on the specified rules (amount > 1000 or within 60 minutes of another transaction with the same name in a different city).
2. Problem type / algorithm category: String parsing, array manipulation, and conditional checking.
3. Step-by-step approach: Parse each transaction string into a dictionary containing the name, time, amount, and city. Iterate through the parsed transactions, checking for amounts greater than 1000. Compare each transaction with the other transactions to find those with the same name but different cities within a 60-minute time window. Store the indices of invalid transactions and return the original transaction strings.
4. Edge cases: Empty transaction list, transactions with same name and city but different times, transactions occurring exactly 60 minutes apart, and transactions with amounts exactly 1000.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(n^2) due to nested loops for comparing transactions. Space complexity is O(n) because the parsed transactions and invalid indices are stored, where n is the number of transactions.
