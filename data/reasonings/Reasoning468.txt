1. Problem summary: Determine if a given string is a valid IPv4 address, a valid IPv6 address, or neither.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: String manipulation, validation.
3. Step-by-step approach: Check if the string contains '.' or ':', then call the corresponding validation function. The validation functions split the string by the delimiter and check each part according to the rules for IPv4 and IPv6 addresses.
4. Edge cases: Empty string, invalid characters, incorrect number of parts, leading zeros in IPv4, parts exceeding the valid range, and handling of uppercase and lowercase hex characters in IPv6.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(1) because the number of parts is fixed (4 for IPv4 and 8 for IPv6). Space complexity is O(1) since the size of the parts array is fixed.
