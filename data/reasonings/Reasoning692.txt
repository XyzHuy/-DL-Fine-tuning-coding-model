1. Problem summary: Find the k most frequent words in a given list of words, sorted by frequency (highest to lowest) and lexicographical order for words with the same frequency.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Heap, Hash Map (Counter), Sorting.
3. Step-by-step approach: Count word frequencies using a Counter. Build a min-heap of (-frequency, word) tuples. Extract the k smallest elements from the heap which effectively gives the k largest frequencies. Extract the words from the tuples.
4. Edge cases: Empty input list, k larger than the number of unique words.
5. Time and space complexity: Time: O(n log k), where n is the number of words. Space: O(n) for the counter and heap.
