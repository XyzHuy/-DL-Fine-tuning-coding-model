1. Problem summary: Minimize total wasted space in a dynamic array by choosing optimal sizes at different times, with a limit on the number of resizes.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Dynamic Programming with precomputation.
3. Step-by-step approach: Precompute the minimum wasted space for contiguous subarrays if they are handled without resizing. Use dynamic programming where dp[i][j] stores the minimum waste for the first i elements using j resizes. Iterate through possible previous resize points to find the optimal split for dp[i][j].
4. Edge cases: Initial state with 0 resizes, and the case where k is large enough to resize at every step change.
5. Time and space complexity: Precomputation is O(n^3) and DP is O(n^2 * k). Total time O(n^3). Space is O(n^2) for cost and O(n*k) for DP, so O(n^2).
