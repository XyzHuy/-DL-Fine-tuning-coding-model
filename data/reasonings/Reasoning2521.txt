1. Problem summary: Find the count of unique prime numbers that divide the product of all numbers in a given array of positive integers.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Number Theory, Prime Factorization, Set operations.
3. Step-by-step approach: Iterate through each number in the input array. For each number, find all its prime factors. Store all unique prime factors found across all numbers into a single set. The final answer is the size of this set.
4. Edge cases: Numbers in the array are positive integers. The constraints guarantee numbers are at least 2, so we don't need to worry about 0 or 1.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is roughly O(N * sqrt(M)), where N is the number of elements in nums and M is the maximum value in nums. Space complexity is O(P), where P is the total number of distinct prime factors.
