1. Problem summary: Calculate the minimum cost to transform the source string into the target string by changing characters, given a set of allowed character transformations and their associated costs.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Graph problem, specifically shortest path on a dense graph (all-pairs shortest path). Floyd-Warshall algorithm is applicable.
3. Step-by-step approach: Represent characters as nodes in a graph. Initialize an adjacency matrix where edges represent direct transformations and their costs. Use Floyd-Warshall to find the shortest path (minimum cost) between every pair of characters. Iterate through source and target strings, summing the minimum costs to transform each character from source to target.
4. Edge cases: If a character in source cannot be transformed into the corresponding character in target (infinite cost), return -1. Handle cases where multiple transformation paths exist for a given character pair, ensuring the minimum cost is chosen.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(alphabet_size^3 + N) where alphabet_size is 26 and N is the length of source/target. Space complexity is O(alphabet_size^2).
