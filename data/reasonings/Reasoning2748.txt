1. Problem summary: Count pairs of indices (i, j) such that i < j and the first digit of nums[i] and the last digit of nums[j] are coprime.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Brute force, Number theory (coprime check).
3. Step-by-step approach: Iterate through all possible pairs of indices (i, j) where i < j. For each pair, extract the first digit of nums[i] and the last digit of nums[j]. Calculate their greatest common divisor (GCD). If the GCD is 1, increment a counter.
4. Edge cases: Single-digit numbers are handled correctly. The constraint nums[i] % 10 != 0 ensures the last digit is never zero, avoiding issues with GCD calculation. Array length is at least 2.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(n^2 * log(max_digit)) due to nested loops and GCD computation. Space complexity is O(1).
