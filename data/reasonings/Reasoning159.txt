1. Problem summary: Find the length of the longest substring containing at most two distinct characters.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Sliding window, string manipulation.
3. Step-by-step approach: Use a sliding window to iterate through the string, maintaining a count of characters within the window. If the number of distinct characters exceeds 2, shrink the window from the left until the condition is met. Track the maximum window length.
4. Edge cases: Empty string, string with only one character, string with only two distinct characters.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(n), where n is the length of the string. Space complexity is O(1) since the hashmap will store at most three characters.
