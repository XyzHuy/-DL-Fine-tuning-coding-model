1. Problem summary: Find the minimum count of Fibonacci numbers that sum up to a given integer k.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Greedy algorithm, Dynamic programming (implicitly via Fibonacci generation).
3. Step-by-step approach: 1. Generate Fibonacci numbers up to k. 2. Greedily subtract the largest possible Fibonacci number from k. 3. Repeat until k becomes 0, counting subtractions.
4. Edge cases: k = 1. The Fibonacci generation naturally handles cases where k is itself a Fibonacci number.
5. Time and space complexity: Time is O(log k) for generating Fibonacci numbers and O(log k) for the greedy subtraction. Space is O(log k) to store Fibonacci numbers.
