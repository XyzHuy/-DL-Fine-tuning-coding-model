1. Problem summary: Find the smallest character in a sorted array of characters that is lexicographically greater than the target character. If no such character exists, return the first character in the array.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Binary search (bisect_right)
3. Step-by-step approach: Use bisect_right to find the index of the first character in the array that is greater than the target. Return the character at that index modulo the length of the array to handle wraparound.
4. Edge cases: Target is larger than all characters in the array, resulting in a wraparound to the beginning of the array.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(log n) due to binary search. Space complexity is O(1).
