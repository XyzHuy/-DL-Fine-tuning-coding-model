1. Problem summary: Given a string representing a range of Excel cells like "C1:F5", return a list of all cells within that range, sorted by column then row.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: String manipulation, iteration, range generation.
3. Step-by-step approach: Extract the start and end column letters and row numbers. Iterate through the character codes of the start and end columns, and for each column, iterate through the row numbers from start to end. Construct the cell string for each combination and add it to the result list.
4. Edge cases: The constraints specify that the input format is always valid and within reasonable bounds (e.g., single-digit rows). The start row/column will always be less than or equal to the end row/column.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O((end_col - start_col) * (end_row - start_row)) due to nested loops. Space complexity is O(1) if we don't count the output list, or O((end_col - start_col) * (end_row - start_row)) if we do.
