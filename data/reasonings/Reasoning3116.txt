1. Problem summary: Find the kth smallest positive integer that can be formed by taking multiples of any single coin denomination, given an infinite supply of each coin.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Binary Search on Answer with Inclusion-Exclusion Principle.
3. Step-by-step approach: Use binary search to find the kth smallest amount. For a given amount (midpoint), use the inclusion-exclusion principle to count how many amounts less than or equal to 'mid' can be formed. The count for a subset of coins is determined by the least common multiple (LCM) of those coins. If the count is less than k, search in the higher half; otherwise, search in the lower half.
4. Edge cases: The problem constraints mention coins.length <= 15, allowing for efficient computation of LCM for subsets. k can be very large, necessitating binary search.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(2^N * N * log(MaxAmount)), where N is the number of coins, and MaxAmount is the upper bound of the binary search. Space complexity is O(N) for recursion or storing subsets if not done iteratively.
