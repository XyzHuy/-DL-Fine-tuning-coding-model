1. Problem summary: Find the integer in an array that most frequently appears immediately after a given key integer.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Frequency counting, iteration.
3. Step-by-step approach: Iterate through adjacent pairs of numbers. If the first number in a pair equals the key, increment the count for the second number. Keep track of the number with the highest count encountered so far.
4. Edge cases: The problem guarantees the key is present, the array length is at least 2, and the answer is unique. Thus, no special handling for empty arrays or missing keys is needed.
5. Time and space complexity: Time is O(n) because we iterate through the array once. Space is O(k) where k is the number of unique targets following the key, or O(n) in the worst case if all elements are unique targets.
