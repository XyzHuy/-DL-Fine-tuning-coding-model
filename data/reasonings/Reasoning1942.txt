1. Problem summary: Assign the smallest available chair to each arriving friend based on their arrival and departure times, and return the chair assigned to a specific target friend.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Simulation, Priority Queue (Min-Heap).
3. Step-by-step approach: Sort friends by arrival time. Maintain two min-heaps: one for available chairs and one for occupied chairs (prioritized by leaving time). Process friends in arrival order. For each friend, first free up chairs from the occupied heap whose leaving time is less than or equal to the current arrival time. Then, assign the smallest available chair (from the available chairs heap or a new chair if none are available). If the current friend is the target, return their assigned chair. Add the current friend's departure time and assigned chair to the occupied heap.
4. Edge cases: No friends arriving or leaving at the exact same time that would require complex tie-breaking beyond the problem's definition. All arrival times are distinct. Chairs are numbered from 0 to infinity.
5. Time and space complexity: Time O(N log N) due to sorting and heap operations, Space O(N) for storing arrival, leaving, and available chairs.
