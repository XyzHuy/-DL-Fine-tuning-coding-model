1. Problem summary: Find the maximum profit achievable from at most two stock transactions given an array of stock prices.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Dynamic Programming, greedy approach.
3. Step-by-step approach: Iterate through the prices, tracking the minimum cost and maximum profit for each of the two possible transactions. Update the minimum cost and maximum profit variables at each step.
4. Edge cases: Empty prices array, prices array with only decreasing prices.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(n) and space complexity is O(1).
