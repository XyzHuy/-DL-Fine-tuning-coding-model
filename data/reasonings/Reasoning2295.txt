1. Problem summary: Given an array of distinct positive integers and a list of operations, where each operation replaces an existing number with a new unique number, return the final state of the array after all operations.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Array manipulation, Hash Map (Dictionary) usage.
3. Step-by-step approach: Use a dictionary to map each number in the initial array to its index. For each operation, find the index of the number to be replaced using the dictionary, update the array at that index with the new number, and then update the dictionary by mapping the new number to the index and removing the old number.
4. Edge cases: The problem guarantees that the number to be replaced always exists and the replacement number does not exist, so no need to check for these. Empty operations list would mean no changes. Empty initial nums list is not possible due to constraints.
5. Time and space complexity: O(n + m) time complexity due to iterating through initial nums and then operations, O(n) space complexity for the hash map.
