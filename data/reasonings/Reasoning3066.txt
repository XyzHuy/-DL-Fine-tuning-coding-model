1. Problem summary: Combine the two smallest elements `x` and `y` into `2*x + y` repeatedly until all elements are at least `k`, minimizing the number of operations.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Greedy approach, Heap (Priority Queue).
3. Step-by-step approach: Use a min-heap to efficiently find and extract the two smallest elements. Repeatedly extract the two smallest, combine them according to the rule, and insert the result back into the heap, counting each operation. Continue until the smallest element in the heap is at least `k`.
4. Edge cases: The input array always has at least two elements. The problem guarantees that an answer always exists. The initial smallest element is already greater than or equal to `k` (0 operations needed).
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(N log N) due to heap operations. Space complexity is O(N) for the heap.
