1. Problem summary: Find the maximum distance Alex can be from the closest person when choosing a seat in a row of seats.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Array traversal, Greedy
3. Step-by-step approach: Find the distance to the first person, the max distance between two people, and the distance to the last person, then return the max of the three.
4. Edge cases: Empty seats at the beginning or end of the row affect maximum distance.
5. Time and space complexity: Time: O(n), Space: O(1)
