1. Problem summary: Given a list representing run-length encoded pairs [frequency, value], decompress it into a flat list.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Array manipulation, iteration.
3. Step-by-step approach: Iterate through the input list in steps of two. For each pair, take the frequency and value. Append the value to the result list, repeated by its frequency.
4. Edge cases: The problem constraints guarantee a non-empty list with an even length, and valid frequency/value ranges, so no significant edge cases need special handling beyond standard iteration.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(N*M) where N is the number of pairs and M is the maximum frequency, as each element is effectively generated. Space complexity is O(Total Elements) to store the decompressed list.
