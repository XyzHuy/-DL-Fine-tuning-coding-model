1. Problem summary: Maximize the count of positive prefix sums by rearranging an integer array.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Greedy algorithm, Sorting.
3. Step-by-step approach: Sort the input array in descending order. Iterate through the sorted array, accumulating the prefix sum. Increment the score for each positive prefix sum encountered. Stop when the prefix sum becomes non-positive.
4. Edge cases: All numbers are negative or zero, resulting in zero score. The array contains only positive numbers, leading to a score equal to the array length.
5. Time and space complexity: O(N log N) time due to sorting, O(1) space if sorting in-place or O(N) if a copy is made.
