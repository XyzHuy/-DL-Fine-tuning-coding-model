1. Problem summary: Count the number of odd integers within a given inclusive range [low, high].
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Mathematical reasoning, number theory.
3. Step-by-step approach: Calculate the total number of integers in the range. If the total count is even, half are odd. If the total count is odd, check if the starting number (low) is odd; if so, there's one more odd number than even numbers in that odd-sized group.
4. Edge cases: Ranges where low and high are both even, both odd, or one is even and the other is odd. Single number ranges.
5. Time and space complexity: O(1) time complexity, O(1) space complexity.
