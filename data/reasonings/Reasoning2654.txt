1. Problem summary: Transform an array of positive integers into all ones using a specific GCD operation, minimizing operations.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Greedy, Number Theory (GCD), Subarray Operations.
3. Step-by-step approach: First, count existing ones. If any exist, the problem reduces to converting non-ones to ones. If no ones exist, find the shortest subarray whose GCD is 1. This shortest subarray takes (length - 1) operations to make one element 1. Then, each of the remaining (n - 1) elements can be made 1 by pairing with an adjacent 1.
4. Edge cases: The array initially contains one or more ones. No subarray can produce a GCD of 1.
5. Time and space complexity: Time is O(n^2) due to nested loops for finding the shortest subarray with GCD 1. Space is O(1) as only a few variables are used.
