1. Problem summary: Reverse a string (character array) in-place.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Two Pointers / In-place reversal.
3. Step-by-step approach: Use two pointers, one at the beginning and one at the end, and swap the characters at these positions until the pointers meet in the middle.
4. Edge cases: Empty string, single character string, even/odd length strings.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(N), space complexity is O(1).
