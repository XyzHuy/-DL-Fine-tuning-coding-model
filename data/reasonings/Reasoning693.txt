1. Problem summary: Determine if the binary representation of a given integer has alternating bits (0 and 1).
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Bit manipulation, string processing.
3. Step-by-step approach: Convert the integer to its binary string representation. Iterate through the string and compare adjacent characters. If any adjacent characters are the same, return false. Otherwise, return true.
4. Edge cases: The input integer is always positive, so no need to handle negative numbers or zero.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(log n) because the binary representation length is log n. Space complexity is O(log n) to store the binary string.
