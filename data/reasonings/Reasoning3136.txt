1. Problem summary: Determine if a given string `word` meets four criteria: minimum length of 3, contains only alphanumeric characters, includes at least one vowel, and includes at least one consonant.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: String manipulation and validation.
3. Step-by-step approach: First, check if the word's length is less than 3; if so, return False. Then, iterate through each character of the word. For each character, verify if it's a digit or a letter; if not, return False. Track whether a vowel and a consonant have been encountered. Finally, return True only if both a vowel and a consonant were found, and all other checks passed.
4. Edge cases: Words shorter than 3 characters, words containing non-alphanumeric characters, words with only vowels, words with only consonants, words with only digits.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(N) where N is the length of the word, due to a single pass. Space complexity is O(1) as only a few boolean flags and a small vowel set are used.
