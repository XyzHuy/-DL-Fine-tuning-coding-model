1. Problem summary: Calculate final bank balance after rounding a purchase amount to the nearest multiple of 10 and deducting it from an initial balance of 100.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Arithmetic, rounding.
3. Step-by-step approach: Add 5 to the purchase amount, perform integer division by 10, round the result to the nearest whole number, multiply by 10 to get the rounded purchase amount, and subtract this from 100.
4. Edge cases: Purchase amount of 0, purchase amounts ending in 5 (which round up).
5. Time and space complexity: O(1) time and O(1) space.
