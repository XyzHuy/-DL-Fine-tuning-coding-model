1. Problem summary: Given an array of coin values and a target sum, find the minimum number of coins to add to the array so that all sums from 1 to target are obtainable using subsequences of the coins.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Greedy algorithm, dynamic programming (implicit reachability).
3. Step-by-step approach: Sort the coins. Maintain a 'reachable' sum, initially 0. Iterate through coins; if a coin is less than or equal to 'reachable + 1', add it to 'reachable'. If a coin is greater, add 'reachable + 1' as a new coin and increment the count of added coins, updating 'reachable' to 'reachable + (reachable + 1)'. Repeat until 'reachable' is at least 'target'.
4. Edge cases: Target is 1, coins array is empty or contains only large values, target is exactly reachable by initial coins.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(N log N) due to sorting, where N is the number of coins. Space complexity is O(1) if sorting in-place, or O(N) depending on sorting implementation.
