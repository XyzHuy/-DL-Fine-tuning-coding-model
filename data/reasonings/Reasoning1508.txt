1. Problem summary: Calculate the sum of a range of elements in a sorted list of all possible continuous subarray sums from a given array, modulo 10^9 + 7.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Array manipulation, sorting, prefix sums (implicitly).
3. Step-by-step approach: First, iterate through the array to generate all possible continuous subarray sums. Then, sort these sums in non-decreasing order. Finally, sum the elements within the specified 1-based range [left, right] from the sorted list and return the result modulo 10^9 + 7.
4. Edge cases: The input array can contain up to 1000 elements. The left and right indices are 1-based and can span the entire sorted sums list. The modulo operation needs to be applied to the final sum.
5. Time and space complexity: Generating sums is O(n^2), sorting is O(n^2 log(n^2)) which simplifies to O(n^2 log n), and summing the range is O(right - left), which is at most O(n^2). Space complexity is O(n^2) to store all subarray sums.
