1. Problem summary: Find the minimum number of contiguous substrings a string of digits can be partitioned into such that the integer value of each substring is at most k.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Greedy approach.
3. Step-by-step approach: Iterate through the string, greedily forming the current substring as long as its integer value does not exceed k. When adding the next digit would exceed k, finalize the current substring as a partition and start a new one with the current digit.
4. Edge cases: If any single digit's value exceeds k, no valid partition exists. An empty or single-digit string needs careful handling in partition counting.
5. Time and space complexity: O(N) time complexity where N is the length of the string s, as each digit is processed once. O(N) space complexity in the worst case to store the current number if it grows large, though effectively O(1) auxiliary space if we consider the number representation.
