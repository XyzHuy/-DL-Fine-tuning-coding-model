1. Problem summary: Given a grid size, starting robot position, and a sequence of moves, calculate for each starting instruction in the sequence, how many moves the robot can make before going out of bounds.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Simulation, Brute Force.
3. Step-by-step approach: Iterate through each possible starting instruction index `i` from 0 to `m-1`. For each `i`, simulate the robot's movement from `startPos` using instructions `s[i:]`. Keep track of the robot's current position and increment a counter for each valid move. Stop simulation if the robot moves out of bounds or all instructions from `i` onwards are processed. Store the count for index `i` in the result array.
4. Edge cases: Robot starts on the edge of the grid, robot is immediately out of bounds with the first instruction, grid size is 1x1, all instructions lead out of bounds immediately.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(m^2) because for each of the m starting positions, we might iterate through up to m instructions. Space complexity is O(m) to store the result array.
