1. Problem summary: Find the minimum and maximum distances between any two distinct critical points in a linked list, where a critical point is a local maxima or minima.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Linked List Traversal, Identifying Local Extrema.
3. Step-by-step approach: Iterate through the linked list keeping track of the previous, current, and next nodes. Identify critical points by checking if the current node's value is strictly greater or smaller than both its neighbors. Store the indices of these critical points. If there are fewer than two critical points, return [-1, -1]. Otherwise, calculate the minimum difference between consecutive critical point indices and the difference between the first and last critical point indices.
4. Edge cases: Linked lists with fewer than 3 nodes, and linked lists with fewer than two critical points.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(N) where N is the number of nodes, as we traverse the list once. Space complexity is O(K) where K is the number of critical points, for storing their indices. In the worst case, K can be O(N), but typically it will be less.
