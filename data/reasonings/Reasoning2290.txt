1. Problem summary: Find the minimum number of obstacles (cells with value 1) to remove to create a path from the top-left to the bottom-right of a grid.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Graph traversal, specifically a variation of Breadth-First Search (BFS) or Dijkstra's algorithm.
3. Step-by-step approach: Use a min-heap to store states (obstacles removed, row, column). Prioritize exploring cells with fewer obstacles removed. From the current cell, explore its neighbors. If a neighbor is an obstacle, add it to the heap with an incremented obstacle count. If it's empty, add it with the same obstacle count. Keep track of visited cells to avoid cycles and redundant computations.
4. Edge cases: The problem statement guarantees that the start and end cells are empty (0). The grid dimensions are at least 1x1. A path might require removing 0 obstacles.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(m * n * log(m * n)) due to heap operations. Space complexity is O(m * n) for the visited set and the heap.
