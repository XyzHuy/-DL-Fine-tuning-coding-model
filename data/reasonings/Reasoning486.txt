1. Problem summary: Determine if Player 1 can win a game where players take turns picking numbers from either end of an array, aiming for a higher score, with ties favoring Player 1.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Dynamic Programming / Recursion (Minimax)
3. Step-by-step approach: Use recursion with memoization to simulate the game. The canWin function calculates the maximum score difference Player 1 can achieve. Base case: empty array returns 0. Recursive step: calculate score difference by picking the first or last element and subtract the score difference from the remaining array. Memoize the results to avoid redundant calculations. Return True if the initial score difference is non-negative.
4. Edge cases: Empty input array (handled by base case).
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(n^2) due to memoization avoiding recomputation of subproblems, where n is the length of nums. Space complexity is O(n^2) due to the memoization dictionary storing results for subproblems and the recursion stack.
