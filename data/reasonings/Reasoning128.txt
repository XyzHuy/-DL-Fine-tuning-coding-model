1. Problem summary: Find the length of the longest consecutive sequence of numbers in an unsorted array of integers.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Array, Hash Set, Sequence Finding.
3. Step-by-step approach: Convert the array to a set for O(1) lookups. Iterate through the set, and for each number, check if it's the start of a consecutive sequence. If so, count the length of the sequence and update the longest streak found so far.
4. Edge cases: Empty input array, duplicate numbers in the input array, sequences that start at the beginning or end of the number range.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(n) because each number is visited at most twice. Space complexity is O(n) due to the set used to store the numbers.
