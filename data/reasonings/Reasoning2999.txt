1. Problem summary: Count integers in a range [start, finish] that end with a specific suffix 's' and whose digits do not exceed 'limit'.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Digit DP.
3. Step-by-step approach: Calculate powerful integers up to 'finish' and subtract those up to 'start - 1'. The digit DP counts numbers less than or equal to a given number with digit constraints and suffix requirement.
4. Edge cases: 's' being longer than the numbers in the range, 'start' being 1, limit being 9, 's' having leading zeros (constraint says no).
5. Time and space complexity: Time is O(log10(finish) * 10 * 2), space is O(log10(finish) * 10 * 2) due to memoization in DP.
