1. Problem summary: Convert an Excel column title (string) to its corresponding column number (integer).
2. Problem type / algorithm category: String manipulation, base-26 conversion.
3. Step-by-step approach: Iterate through the string, converting each character to its numerical value (A=1, B=2, ..., Z=26). Update the result by multiplying it by 26 and adding the current character's value.
4. Edge cases: Empty string (not possible according to constraints), single-character input, multi-character input.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(n) where n is the length of the input string. Space complexity is O(1).
