1. Problem summary: Given an integer n, generate a list of strings where each element is "Fizz" if the index is divisible by 3, "Buzz" if divisible by 5, "FizzBuzz" if divisible by both, and the number itself as a string otherwise.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: String manipulation, conditional logic, iteration.
3. Step-by-step approach: Iterate from 1 to n (inclusive). In each iteration, check divisibility by 3 and 5 using modulo operator. Append the corresponding string to the result list. If none of the conditions are met, convert the number to a string and append it.
4. Edge cases: Input n can be 1.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(n) because we iterate from 1 to n. Space complexity is O(n) because we store the result in a list of size n.
