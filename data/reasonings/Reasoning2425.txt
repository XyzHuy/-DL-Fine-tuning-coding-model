1. Problem summary: Given two arrays nums1 and nums2, calculate the bitwise XOR of all possible pairwise XORs between elements of nums1 and nums2.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Bit manipulation, XOR properties.
3. Step-by-step approach: Analyze the contribution of each element from nums1 and nums2 to the final XOR sum. Notice that an element `n1` from `nums1` appears `len(nums2)` times in the `nums3` array (paired with each element of `nums2`). Similarly, an element `n2` from `nums2` appears `len(nums1)` times. If an element appears an even number of times in a XOR sum, its contribution is 0. If it appears an odd number of times, its contribution is itself. Thus, if `len(nums2)` is odd, `n1` contributes to the final XOR sum. If `len(nums1)` is odd, `n2` contributes to the final XOR sum. The final result is the XOR sum of elements from `nums1` where `len(nums2)` is odd, XORed with the XOR sum of elements from `nums2` where `len(nums1)` is odd.
4. Edge cases: The lengths of nums1 and nums2 can be 1. The constraints ensure non-empty arrays.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(N + M) where N is the length of nums1 and M is the length of nums2, due to single passes. Space complexity is O(1) as only a few variables are used.
