1. Problem summary: Given a complete binary tree structure and several queries, each query involves adding an edge between two nodes, finding the cycle length, and then removing the edge.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Tree traversal, graph algorithms, Lowest Common Ancestor (LCA).
3. Step-by-step approach: For each query [a, b], find the Lowest Common Ancestor (LCA) of nodes a and b. The cycle length is the distance from a to LCA plus the distance from b to LCA, plus the added edge itself. The distance can be found by repeatedly dividing the node value by 2 until they meet.
4. Edge cases: The problem statement guarantees n >= 2 and valid node values within the tree range, so explicit edge case handling for invalid inputs isn't strictly necessary based on constraints. The case where a or b is the root (value 1) is handled naturally by the LCA logic.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(M * log(N)), where M is the number of queries and N is the maximum node value (2^n - 1). Space complexity is O(1) for the provided solution if we don't consider the output array, or O(M) to store the results.
