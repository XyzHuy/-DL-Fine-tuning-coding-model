1. Problem summary: Determine if an array can be divided into disjoint increasing subsequences of length at least k.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Array analysis, frequency counting.
3. Step-by-step approach: Count the frequency of each number, find the maximum frequency, and check if the array length is greater than or equal to max_freq * k.
4. Edge cases: Empty array (handled implicitly), k=1 (always true).
5. Time and space complexity: Time: O(n), Space: O(n) for the Counter.
