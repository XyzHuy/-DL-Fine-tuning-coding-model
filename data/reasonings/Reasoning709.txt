1. Problem summary: Convert all uppercase letters in a given string to lowercase.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: String manipulation.
3. Step-by-step approach: Utilize the built-in string.lower() method to convert the entire string to lowercase.
4. Edge cases: Empty string, string with no uppercase characters, string with mixed case characters, string with special characters.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(n) where n is the length of the string, and space complexity is O(1) as it creates a new string of the same length.
