1. Problem summary: Calculate the minimum time to complete all courses with prerequisite dependencies and individual course completion times, allowing parallel course execution.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Topological Sort, Dynamic Programming on DAG.
3. Step-by-step approach: Build an adjacency list graph and compute in-degrees for each course. Initialize a queue with courses having zero in-degree and their completion times. Use dynamic programming to store the earliest completion time for each course, updating it as prerequisites are met. The final result is the maximum completion time among all courses.
4. Edge cases: A graph with no relations (all courses can be taken in parallel), a single course, or a linear chain of dependencies. The problem guarantees a DAG.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(V + E), where V is the number of courses and E is the number of relations, due to graph construction and BFS traversal. Space complexity is O(V + E) for storing the graph and O(V) for in-degree and DP arrays.
