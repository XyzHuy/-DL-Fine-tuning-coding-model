1. Problem summary: Given two anagrams s1 and s2, find the minimum number of swaps needed to transform s1 into s2.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Graph traversal / Breadth-First Search (BFS). The problem can be modeled as finding the shortest path in a graph where nodes are strings and edges represent a single swap.
3. Step-by-step approach: Perform a BFS starting from s1. In each step, generate all possible neighbor strings by swapping two characters in the current string. Only consider swaps that move the string closer to s2, meaning swapping a character at an incorrect position with a character that should be at that position. Maintain a visited set to avoid cycles. The BFS continues until s2 is reached, at which point the number of swaps is returned.
4. Edge cases: The strings s1 and s2 could be identical (requiring 0 swaps). Input strings s1 and s2 are guaranteed to be anagrams and of the same length.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(N^2 * A^N), where N is the length of the strings and A is the size of the alphabet. The N^2 factor comes from generating neighbors. The A^N comes from the number of possible strings. The space complexity is O(A^N) for the queue and visited set.
