1. Problem summary: Construct a binary tree from a list of parent-child relationships where each relationship specifies if the child is left or right.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Tree construction, Graph traversal (implicit).
3. Step-by-step approach: Use a dictionary to store TreeNodes keyed by their values. Iterate through descriptions, creating nodes if they don't exist and linking them as parent/child. Identify the root by finding the node value that appears as a parent but never as a child.
4. Edge cases: The problem guarantees a valid tree and unique values, so no need to worry about cycles or missing nodes for existing relationships. The single root node logic implicitly handles cases with minimal tree structures.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(N) where N is the number of descriptions, as each description is processed once. Space complexity is O(N) to store the nodes in the dictionary.
