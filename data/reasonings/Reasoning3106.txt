1. Problem summary: Transform a given string s into the lexicographically smallest string t by changing characters, such that the total cyclic distance between s and t does not exceed k.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Greedy algorithm, String manipulation.
3. Step-by-step approach: Iterate through the string from left to right. For each character, determine the cost to change it to 'a' (the lexicographically smallest character). If this cost is within the remaining budget k, change the character to 'a' and deduct the cost from k. Otherwise, change the character as much as possible towards 'a' using the remaining k and exhaust k.
4. Edge cases: k = 0 (no changes allowed), s consists of only one character, k is large enough to change all characters to 'a'.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity O(N), where N is the length of the string s. Space complexity O(N) for storing the modified string.
