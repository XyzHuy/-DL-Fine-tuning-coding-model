1. Problem summary: Calculate the number of valid simultaneous move combinations for multiple chess pieces (rook, queen, bishop) on an 8x8 board, ensuring no collisions at any time step.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Combinatorics, Backtracking/Brute Force with pruning, Simulation.
3. Step-by-step approach: For each piece, generate all possible destination squares it can reach in one move. Then, iterate through all combinations of these destinations for all pieces. For each combination, simulate the moves second by second to check for collisions.
4. Edge cases: A piece can choose to stay in its current position. Two adjacent pieces can swap positions in one second without collision. There is at most one queen.
5. Time and space complexity: High due to iterating through all move combinations and simulating each. Space is used for storing possible moves and simulation states.
