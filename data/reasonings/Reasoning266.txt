1. Problem summary: Determine if any permutation of a given string can form a palindrome.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: String manipulation, Palindrome, Frequency counting.
3. Step-by-step approach: Count the frequency of each character in the string. Check if the number of characters with odd frequencies is at most 1.
4. Edge cases: Empty string (should return True), string with only one character (should return True), string with all unique characters (should return False if length is even, True if length is odd).
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(n) due to counting character frequencies. Space complexity is O(1) since the number of possible characters is limited (lowercase English letters).
