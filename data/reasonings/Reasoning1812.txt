1. Problem summary: Determine if a given chessboard square, represented by a 2-character coordinate (letter then number), is white or black.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Simple arithmetic / pattern recognition.
3. Step-by-step approach: Convert the column letter to a numerical representation. Add this number to the row number. Check if the sum is odd (white) or even (black).
4. Edge cases: The problem guarantees valid chessboard coordinates, so no invalid inputs need handling.
5. Time and space complexity: O(1) time and O(1) space.
