1. Problem summary: Count pairs of points (A, B) where A is upper-left of B and no other points are within their bounding rectangle or on its borders.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Brute-force with sorting and geometric checks.
3. Step-by-step approach: Sort points by x-coordinate ascending, then y-coordinate descending. Iterate through all possible pairs (i, j) where i < j. For each pair, check if point i is upper-left of point j (i.e., points[i][0] <= points[j][0] and points[i][1] >= points[j][1]). If it is, then iterate through all points k between i and j to ensure no other point falls within the rectangle defined by points i and j. Increment count if no intermediate points are found.
4. Edge cases: All points being collinear, points forming vertical or horizontal lines, no valid pairs found.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(n^3) due to three nested loops, and space complexity is O(1) if sorting is done in-place, or O(n) if a copy is made for sorting.
