1. Problem summary: Construct a strictly increasing array of positive integers of size n such that the bitwise AND of all its elements is x, and minimize the last element.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Bitwise operations, Greedy approach.
3. Step-by-step approach: Initialize the first element to x. For each subsequent element needed (n-1 times), increment the current number and then perform a bitwise OR with x to ensure all bits of x are preserved.
4. Edge cases: n=1 (the array is just [x], so the last element is x). x=0 (all numbers must be 0, which contradicts positive integers, so this case is invalid or implies 0). Constraints state x >= 1.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(n) because we iterate n-1 times. Space complexity is O(1) as we only use a few variables.
