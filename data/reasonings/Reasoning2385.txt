1. Problem summary: The problem asks for the minimum time required to infect all nodes in a binary tree, starting from a given node. Infection spreads to adjacent nodes each minute.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Graph traversal, specifically Breadth-First Search (BFS) after converting the tree to an adjacency list.
3. Step-by-step approach: First, convert the binary tree into an undirected graph (adjacency list) where edges connect parent-child nodes. Then, perform a BFS starting from the 'start' node. The BFS level by level represents minutes, and the maximum depth of the BFS indicates the total time.
4. Edge cases: A tree with only one node (root) should result in 0 minutes. The 'start' node might be the root, a leaf, or an internal node.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(N) for building the graph and O(N) for BFS, totaling O(N). Space complexity is O(N) for storing the graph and O(N) for the BFS queue and visited set, totaling O(N), where N is the number of nodes.
