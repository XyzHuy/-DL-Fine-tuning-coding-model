1. Problem summary: Given a string and pairs of swappable indices, find the lexicographically smallest string achievable through any number of swaps.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Graph traversal (DFS), connected components, sorting.
3. Step-by-step approach: Build a graph where nodes are indices and edges represent swappable pairs. Find connected components in the graph using DFS. For each component, sort the indices and characters, then place the sorted characters back into the original string at the sorted indices.
4. Edge cases: Empty string, empty pairs list, single character string, pairs that form disjoint or overlapping components.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(N log N) due to sorting within each connected component, where N is the length of the string. The space complexity is O(N) to store the graph, visited array, and connected components.
