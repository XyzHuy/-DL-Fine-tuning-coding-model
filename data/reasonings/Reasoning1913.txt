1. Problem summary: Find four distinct indices from an integer array to form two pairs, maximizing the difference between the product of the first pair and the product of the second pair.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Sorting, Finding extreme values.
3. Step-by-step approach: Sort the input array. Identify the two largest numbers and the two smallest numbers. Calculate the product of the two largest and subtract the product of the two smallest.
4. Edge cases: The problem constraints guarantee at least 4 elements, so no need to worry about arrays smaller than 4. All numbers are positive, simplifying multiplication.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is dominated by sorting (O(N log N)). Space complexity is O(1) if sorting is in-place, or O(N) if a copy is made depending on the sort implementation.
