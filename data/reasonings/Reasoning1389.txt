1. Problem summary: Construct a target array by inserting elements from `nums` at specified positions in `index`.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Array manipulation, insertion.
3. Step-by-step approach: Initialize an empty target array. Iterate through `nums` and `index` simultaneously. For each pair `(nums[i], index[i])`, insert `nums[i]` into the target array at the position `index[i]`.
4. Edge cases: Input arrays `nums` and `index` have lengths between 1 and 100. `nums[i]` values are between 0 and 100. `index[i]` values are valid for insertion (0 <= index[i] <= i). Single element arrays.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(n^2) due to repeated insertions in a list. Space complexity is O(n) for the target array.
