1. Problem summary: Determine if an integer is a palindrome without converting it to a string.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Numerical manipulation.
3. Step-by-step approach: First, handle the negative number edge case. Then reverse the integer and compare it to the original integer.
4. Edge cases: Negative numbers are not palindromes.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(log(x)) where x is the input integer. Space complexity is O(1).
