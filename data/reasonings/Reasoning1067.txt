1. Problem summary: Count the occurrences of a digit `d` within the integers in the range `[low, high]`.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Counting, digit manipulation.
3. Step-by-step approach: Define a helper function `count_digit(n, digit)` to count the occurrences of `digit` from 1 to `n`. Iterate through powers of 10, and for each digit position, calculate how many times the given digit appears. Handle the cases where the current digit is greater than, equal to, or less than the target digit. Special care is needed for the digit 0. Calculate the result as `count_digit(high, d) - count_digit(low - 1, d)`.
4. Edge cases: The digit `d` can be 0. The input range can be large. Need to handle leading zeros correctly.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(log(high)) because the while loop iterates based on the number of digits in high. Space complexity is O(1) as we are only using a few integer variables.
