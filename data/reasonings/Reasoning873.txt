1. Problem summary: Find the length of the longest Fibonacci-like subsequence in a given strictly increasing array of positive integers.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Dynamic Programming. The problem requires finding a subsequence that follows the Fibonacci property, which is efficiently solved using DP to store and reuse intermediate results.
3. Step-by-step approach: Create a hash map to store the index of each number in the array. Iterate through all possible pairs (arr[j], arr[k]) where k > j. Check if arr[k] - arr[j] exists in the array and its index i is less than j. If it does, then arr[i] + arr[j] = arr[k], which indicates that we found a Fibonacci-like triplet. Use a DP table to store the lengths of Fibonacci-like subsequences ending at (j, k). Update the maximum length found so far.
4. Edge cases: The length of the Fibonacci-like subsequence must be at least 3. If no such subsequence is found, return 0. Also, the input array must be strictly increasing.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(n^2) due to the nested loops. Space complexity is O(n^2) for the dp table.
