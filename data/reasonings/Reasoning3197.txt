1. Problem summary: Find the minimum sum of areas of three non-overlapping rectangles that cover all '1's in a 2D binary grid.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Brute force / Combinatorial search with geometric constraints.
3. Step-by-step approach: Iterate through all possible ways to partition the grid into three rectangles. This involves considering horizontal and vertical splits. For each split, calculate the area of the bounding box containing '1's within each of the three resulting subgrids using a helper function. The minimum sum of these areas across all valid partitions is the answer.
4. Edge cases: Grids with fewer than three '1's are ruled out by constraints. Empty rectangles (no '1's) should contribute zero area. Rectangles are allowed to touch.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(M^3 * N^3) due to nested loops for partitioning and the helper function iterating through subgrids. Space complexity is O(1) as only a few variables are used.
