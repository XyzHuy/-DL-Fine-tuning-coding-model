1. Problem summary: Determine if string 'goal' can be obtained by rotating string 's' any number of times.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: String manipulation / substring search.
3. Step-by-step approach: Check if the lengths of the strings are equal. If not, return false. Concatenate string 's' with itself. Check if 'goal' is a substring of the concatenated string.
4. Edge cases: Empty strings, strings of different lengths, 's' equals 'goal'.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(N) due to the substring check (N being the length of s). Space complexity is O(N) because of the concatenated string.
