1. Problem summary: Determine if a given popped sequence could have been the result of push and pop operations on a stack, given a pushed sequence.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Stack simulation.
3. Step-by-step approach: Simulate the push and pop operations using a stack. Iterate through the pushed array, pushing each element onto the stack. After each push, check if the top of the stack matches the next element in the popped array. If they match, pop the element from the stack and advance the index in the popped array. Finally, if the stack is empty, then the popped sequence is valid.
4. Edge cases: Empty pushed or popped arrays, cases where the popped sequence is impossible given the pushed sequence.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(N), where N is the length of the pushed array. Space complexity is O(N) in the worst case, when the stack contains all the elements of the pushed array.
