1. Problem summary: Determine if it's possible to eat a specific type of candy on a specific day, given daily candy limits and sequential eating rules.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Prefix Sum, Greedy Approach, Range Queries.
3. Step-by-step approach: Calculate prefix sums of candies to know total candies up to a certain type. For each query, determine the earliest and latest possible days to reach the favorite candy type based on daily limits. Check if the favorite day falls within this range.
4. Edge cases: Zero candies of a type (implicitly handled by prefix sum), very large daily capacities, or very large favorite days.
5. Time and space complexity: Time O(N + Q) where N is candiesCount length and Q is queries length, Space O(N) for prefix sum.
