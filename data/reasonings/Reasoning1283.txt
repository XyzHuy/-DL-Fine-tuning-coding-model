1. Problem summary: Find the smallest positive integer divisor such that the sum of each element in nums divided by this divisor (rounded up) is less than or equal to a given threshold.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Binary Search on the answer.
3. Step-by-step approach: Define a helper function to check if a given divisor satisfies the threshold condition by summing the ceiling divisions. Perform binary search on the possible range of divisors (1 to max(nums)). If the current mid-divisor is valid, try smaller divisors by moving the right boundary; otherwise, try larger divisors by moving the left boundary.
4. Edge cases: The problem guarantees an answer exists. The smallest possible divisor is 1, and the largest possible divisor is the maximum value in nums.
5. Time and space complexity: O(N * log(M)), where N is the length of nums and M is the maximum value in nums. Space complexity is O(1).
