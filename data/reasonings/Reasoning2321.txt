1. Problem summary: Given two integer arrays nums1 and nums2 of equal length, we can swap a subarray from nums1 with the corresponding subarray in nums2 once. The goal is to maximize the score, which is the maximum of the sums of the modified nums1 and nums2.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Dynamic Programming (Kadane's Algorithm variant) for Maximum Subarray Sum.
3. Step-by-step approach: Calculate the initial sums of nums1 and nums2. For each array, consider the effect of swapping a subarray from the other array. This can be framed as finding the maximum subarray sum of the difference array (e.g., nums2[i] - nums1[i]). Apply Kadane's algorithm to find the maximum possible increase in sum for nums1 by swapping a subarray from nums2, and vice-versa. The final answer is the maximum of the initial sums and the sums after the best possible swap.
4. Edge cases: The subarray swap can be of length 0 (i.e., no swap, which means no operation performed). The Kadane's algorithm variant needs to handle cases where all differences are negative, correctly returning 0 for no effective swap.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(n) because we iterate through the arrays a constant number of times. Space complexity is O(1) as we only use a few variables to store sums and maximum differences.
