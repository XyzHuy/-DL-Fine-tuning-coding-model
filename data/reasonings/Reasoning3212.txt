1. Problem summary: Count submatrices starting from (0,0) with equal 'X' and 'Y' counts, and at least one 'X'.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Brute Force, Iteration over Submatrices.
3. Step-by-step approach: Iterate through all possible bottom-right corners (i, j) of submatrices starting from (0,0). For each (i, j), iterate through all cells within the submatrix from (0,0) to (i,j) to count 'X' and 'Y'. If 'X' count is positive and equal to 'Y' count, increment the total count.
4. Edge cases: The grid might contain only '.' characters, or only 'X' or 'Y' characters, or a mix where no submatrix satisfies the conditions. Empty grid is not possible per constraints.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(m^3 * n^3) due to four nested loops. Space complexity is O(1) as only a few variables are used.
