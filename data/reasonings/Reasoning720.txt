1. Problem summary: Find the longest word from a given list of words that can be built one character at a time by other words in the same list. If multiple such words exist, return the lexicographically smallest one.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: String manipulation, sorting, set.
3. Step-by-step approach: Sort the words based on their lengths and lexicographical order. Iterate through the sorted words, maintaining a set of valid words. If a word can be built by adding a character to a valid word or if it has length 1, add it to the valid words set and update the longest word found so far.
4. Edge cases: Empty input list, no buildable words, multiple buildable words with same length.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is dominated by sorting O(n log n), where n is the number of words. Space complexity is O(n) to store the set of valid words.
