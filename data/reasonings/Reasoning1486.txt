1. Problem summary: Calculate the bitwise XOR sum of an array where elements are generated by start + 2*i for i from 0 to n-1.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Iteration, Bitwise Operations.
3. Step-by-step approach: Initialize a result variable to 0. Iterate n times. In each iteration, calculate the current element (start + 2*i) and XOR it with the result. Return the final result.
4. Edge cases: n = 1.
5. Time and space complexity: Time O(n), Space O(1).
