1. Problem summary: Count triplets (a[i], b[j], c[k]) where the bitwise XOR sum has an even number of set bits.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Bit manipulation, Counting, Combinatorics.
3. Step-by-step approach: First, for each array, count numbers with an even number of set bits and those with an odd number of set bits. Then, combine these counts using the property that XORing two numbers with an even number of set bits results in an even count, XORing two numbers with an odd number of set bits results in an even count, and XORing one even and one odd results in an odd count. Specifically, we need (even, even, even), (even, odd, odd), (odd, even, odd), and (odd, odd, even) combinations of bit parity.
4. Edge cases: Empty arrays are not possible due to constraints. Numbers are within a small range (0-100).
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(N), where N is the total number of elements across all arrays, due to iterating through each array once to count bit parity. Space complexity is O(1) as we only store a few counters.
