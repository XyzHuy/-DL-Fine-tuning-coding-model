1. Problem summary: Given an integer n, find the smallest integer k such that n can be represented as a sequence of 1s in base k.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Number theory, binary search (implied).
3. Step-by-step approach: Iterate through possible lengths of the sequence of 1s in base k. For each length, calculate the potential base k using root approximation. Check if the sum of the geometric series with base k and length equals n. If found, return k as a string. If no k is found for any length, return n-1 as a string.
4. Edge cases: The minimum good base is 2. The maximum length of the sequence of 1s is determined by the number of bits of n. If no good base is found, return n-1 which is always a good base.
5. Time and space complexity: The time complexity is O(log n * log n) because of the loop and the power calculations within the loop. Space complexity is O(1).
