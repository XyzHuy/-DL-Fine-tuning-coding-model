1. Problem summary: Count the number of segments (contiguous non-space characters) in a given string.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: String manipulation.
3. Step-by-step approach: Split the string by spaces using the `split()` method, which handles multiple spaces correctly, and then return the length of the resulting list.
4. Edge cases: Empty string, string with only spaces, string with leading/trailing spaces, string with multiple spaces between words.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(n) due to the split operation. Space complexity is O(n) in the worst case where the string contains no spaces, as the split operation creates a list containing the original string.
