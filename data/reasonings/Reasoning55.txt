1. Problem summary: Determine if it's possible to reach the last index of an array given jump lengths at each position.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Greedy algorithm.
3. Step-by-step approach: Iterate through the array, keeping track of the farthest reachable index. If the current index exceeds the farthest reachable index, return false. Update the farthest reachable index at each step. If at any point the farthest reachable index is greater than or equal to the last index, return true.
4. Edge cases: Single element array, zero jump length at the beginning, array where the end is not reachable.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(n), space complexity is O(1).
