1. Problem summary: Given an 8x8 chessboard with a rook, bishops, and pawns, find the number of pawns the rook can attack. The rook can move horizontally and vertically until it encounters another piece or the edge of the board.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Array traversal, Simulation.
3. Step-by-step approach: Find the rook's position. Iterate through all four possible directions (up, down, left, right). In each direction, move one cell at a time until an edge, a pawn, or another piece is reached. If a pawn is reached, increment the count and stop moving in that direction. If another piece is reached, stop moving in that direction.
4. Edge cases: The board is empty except for the rook, the rook is surrounded by bishops, the rook is at the edge of the board.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(1) because the board size is fixed at 8x8, and the rook can move at most 7 steps in each direction. Space complexity is O(1) because no extra space is used that scales with the input size.
