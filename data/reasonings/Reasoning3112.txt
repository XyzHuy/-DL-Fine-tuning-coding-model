1. Problem summary: Find the minimum time to reach each node from node 0 in a weighted undirected graph, considering each node disappears at a specific time. Return -1 if a node is unreachable or disappears before being reached.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Shortest path algorithm on a weighted graph with time constraints (modified Dijkstra).
3. Step-by-step approach: Initialize distances to infinity, starting node distance to 0. Use a priority queue to explore nodes. When exploring a node, if the current time to reach it is less than its disappearance time and also less than the previously recorded minimum time, update the minimum time for its neighbors and add them to the priority queue.
4. Edge cases: Node 0 itself, nodes that disappear immediately or before any path can reach them, disconnected components, multiple edges between nodes, starting node being unreachable.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(E log V) where E is the number of edges and V is the number of nodes, due to Dijkstra's algorithm. Space complexity is O(V + E) for storing the graph and priority queue.
