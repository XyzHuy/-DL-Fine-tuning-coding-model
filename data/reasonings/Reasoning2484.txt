1. Problem summary: Count the number of palindromic subsequences of length 5 in a given digit string, modulo 10^9 + 7.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Dynamic Programming, Combinatorics.
3. Step-by-step approach: Use four DP tables: `left` to count occurrences of digits up to an index, `right` for occurrences from an index to the end, `left_pairs` to count pairs of digits as subsequences ending before an index, and `right_pairs` for pairs starting after an index. Iterate through potential middle characters and combine counts from `left_pairs` and `right_pairs` to form palindromes of length 5.
4. Edge cases: String length less than 5.
5. Time and space complexity: O(N * D^2) time and O(N * D^2) space, where N is the length of the string and D is the number of possible digits (10).
