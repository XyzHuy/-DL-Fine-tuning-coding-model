1. Problem summary: Find the maximum possible length x such that at least k ribbons of length x can be cut from given ribbons.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Binary Search on Answer.
3. Step-by-step approach: Binary search for the maximum possible length x. For a given length, check if at least k ribbons can be formed by summing up the number of ribbons of that length obtainable from each original ribbon. If possible, try a larger length; otherwise, try a smaller length.
4. Edge cases: If no length can satisfy the condition, return 0. This is handled by the initialization of the result and the binary search range.
5. Time and space complexity: O(N * log(M)), where N is the number of ribbons and M is the maximum ribbon length. Space complexity is O(1).
