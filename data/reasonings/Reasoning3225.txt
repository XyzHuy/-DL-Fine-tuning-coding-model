1. Problem summary: Maximize the score by strategically coloring columns, where score is sum of white cells adjacent to black cells.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Dynamic Programming.
3. Step-by-step approach: Use DP states representing maximum score ending at a column, considering whether the current column's bottom-most black cell is deeper or shallower than the previous. Prefix sums help calculate column segment sums efficiently.
4. Edge cases: The grid can be of size 1x1. The problem implies that operations can be performed on any column and any row, meaning all combinations are possible.
5. Time and space complexity: O(n^3) time due to three nested loops (columns, current row, previous row) and O(n^2) space for prefix sums and DP states.
