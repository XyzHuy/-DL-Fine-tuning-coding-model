1. Problem summary: Determine if an integer can be expressed as a sum of unique powers of three.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Number theory, Base conversion (ternary).
3. Step-by-step approach: Repeatedly check the remainder when dividing by 3. If the remainder is ever 2, it's impossible. Otherwise, keep dividing by 3.
4. Edge cases: The input n is always positive based on constraints. The algorithm naturally handles powers of 3 and combinations.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(log3 n) because of repeated division. Space complexity is O(1) as only a few variables are used.
