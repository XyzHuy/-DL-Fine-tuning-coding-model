1. Problem summary: Two players, Alice and Bob, take turns removing stones. The player who makes the sum of removed stones divisible by 3 loses. Alice wins if Bob loses, Bob wins if Alice loses or all stones are removed and the sum is not divisible by 3.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Game theory, dynamic programming (implicitly, due to optimal play), number theory (modulo arithmetic).
3. Step-by-step approach: Calculate the counts of stones with values modulo 3 (0, 1, 2). If the count of stones with value % 3 == 0 is even, Alice wins if there are stones with remainder 1 and stones with remainder 2 available. If the count of stones with value % 3 == 0 is odd, Alice wins if the absolute difference between the counts of stones with remainder 1 and remainder 2 is greater than 1.
4. Edge cases: If there are no stones of certain remainders (e.g., only stones with remainder 1 and 0), or if all stones have the same remainder.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(N) for iterating through stones. Space complexity is O(1) as we only store counts for three remainders.
