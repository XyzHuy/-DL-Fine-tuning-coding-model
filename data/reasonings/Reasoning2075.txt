1. Problem summary: Reconstruct the original string from a ciphered string encoded using a slanted transposition cipher with a given number of rows.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: String manipulation, matrix traversal, decoding.
3. Step-by-step approach: Calculate the number of columns based on the encoded text length and rows. Reconstruct the matrix by filling it row by row with the encoded text. Traverse the matrix diagonally in the specified order to extract the original characters. Remove any trailing spaces from the reconstructed string.
4. Edge cases: Encoded text can be empty. The number of rows can be 1. The encoded text might contain spaces.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(N) where N is the length of encodedText, due to matrix filling and traversal. Space complexity is O(N) for storing the matrix.
