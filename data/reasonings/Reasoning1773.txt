1. Problem summary: Count the number of items in a list that match a given rule based on type, color, or name.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Array traversal, conditional checking.
3. Step-by-step approach: Map the ruleKey to the correct index (0 for type, 1 for color, 2 for name), then iterate through each item and check if the element at the determined index matches the ruleValue, incrementing a counter for each match.
4. Edge cases: An empty items list (though constraints say length >= 1), or when no items match the rule.
5. Time and space complexity: Time O(N) where N is the number of items, Space O(1).
