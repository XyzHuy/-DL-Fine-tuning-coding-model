1. Problem summary: Determine if the root node's value equals the sum of its immediate left and right children's values in a tree with exactly three nodes.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Tree traversal, basic arithmetic comparison.
3. Step-by-step approach: Access the root node's value, the left child's value, and the right child's value. Compare the root's value with the sum of the children's values. Return true if they are equal, false otherwise.
4. Edge cases: The problem statement guarantees exactly three nodes (root, left, right), so null children or a null root are implicitly handled by this structure. The constraints on node values are relevant for the arithmetic operation.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(1) as it's a direct access and comparison. Space complexity is O(1) as no extra data structures are used.
