1. Problem summary: Find the minimum days to eat n oranges, with daily options to eat 1, n/2 (if divisible by 2), or 2*(n/3) (if divisible by 3) oranges.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Dynamic programming with memoization (or recursion with caching).
3. Step-by-step approach: Use recursion with memoization. For a given number of oranges n, calculate the minimum days by considering the three possible moves: eating 1, eating n/2 (if possible), and eating 2*(n/3) (if possible). The result for n is 1 plus the minimum of the results from these moves.
4. Edge cases: The base case is when n = 0 or n = 1, where the minimum days are 0 or 1 respectively. The constraint n >= 1 needs to be handled.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(N) where N is the input n, due to memoization. Space complexity is O(N) for the memoization cache.
