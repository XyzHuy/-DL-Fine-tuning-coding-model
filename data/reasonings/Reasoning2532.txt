1. Problem summary: Simulate the process of k workers moving n boxes across a river using a single bridge, prioritizing efficiency and handling bridge access rules to find the total time until the last box is moved.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Simulation, Priority Queue (Heap).
3. Step-by-step approach: Use priority queues to manage workers on the left and right sides, and those currently performing tasks. Iterate through time, processing worker movements and task completions based on efficiency and the rules for bridge usage. Advance time if no workers are immediately available.
4. Edge cases: All workers might be busy simultaneously, requiring time advancement. All boxes might be moved before all workers have completed their tasks.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(N * K * log K) or O(N * log K) in practice due to heap operations for N box movements and K workers. Space complexity is O(K) for storing workers in priority queues.
