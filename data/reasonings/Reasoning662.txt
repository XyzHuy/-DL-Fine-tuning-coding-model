1. Problem summary: Given the root of a binary tree, find the maximum width of the tree, where width is defined as the number of nodes (including null nodes) between the leftmost and rightmost non-null nodes at each level.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Breadth-First Search (BFS), Tree traversal.
3. Step-by-step approach: Use BFS to traverse the tree level by level. Assign each node an index based on its position in a complete binary tree. At each level, the width is calculated as the difference between the largest and smallest indices plus one. Keep track of the maximum width seen so far.
4. Edge cases: Empty tree (root is None), single node tree, skewed trees.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(N), where N is the number of nodes in the tree. Space complexity is O(W), where W is the maximum width of the tree (the maximum number of nodes at any level), which in the worst case can be O(N).
