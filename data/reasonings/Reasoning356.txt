1. Problem summary: Determine if a set of 2D points can be reflected symmetrically across a vertical line.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Geometry, Hashing (Set), Symmetry Detection.
3. Step-by-step approach: Find the minimum and maximum x coordinates, compute the potential reflection line's x-value, and then check if the reflected point of each unique point exists in the set of points.
4. Edge cases: Empty input list, duplicate points.
5. Time and space complexity: Time: O(n), Space: O(n) where n is the number of points.
