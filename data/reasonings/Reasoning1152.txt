1. Problem summary: The problem asks to find the most frequent 3-website sequence visited by users, given username, timestamp, and website visit data. If there are ties, return the lexicographically smallest sequence.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Hash table, sorting, and combinations. This problem involves data aggregation, pattern generation, and frequency counting.
3. Step-by-step approach: First, combine the timestamp, username, and website data and sort it by timestamp. Then, group the websites visited by each user based on their visit order. Generate all possible 3-website sequences for each user. Count the occurrences of each sequence, making sure each user only contributes once to the count of each pattern. Finally, find the sequence with the highest count and, in case of ties, select the lexicographically smallest sequence.
4. Edge cases: Multiple users visiting the same pattern, ensuring each user is counted only once per pattern, and handling ties in pattern frequency using lexicographical order.
5. Time and space complexity: The time complexity is dominated by sorting O(N log N) and generating combinations O(N^3) in the worst case for each user, where N is the number of website visits. The space complexity is O(N) to store the user website visits and O(U * W^3) to store all possible website patterns and their counts, where U is the number of users and W is the maximum number of websites a user visits.
