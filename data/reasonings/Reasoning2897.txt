1. Problem summary: Maximize the sum of squares of k chosen elements from an array after applying bitwise AND/OR operations any number of times.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Bit manipulation and greedy approach.
3. Step-by-step approach: Count the frequency of each bit across all numbers. Greedily construct the largest possible k numbers by setting bits if their count is positive, decrementing the count for each bit used. Finally, calculate the sum of squares of these k numbers modulo 10^9 + 7.
4. Edge cases: The constraints on k and nums.length, and the value of nums[i] up to 10^9 fit within 32 bits.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(N*B + K*B) where N is the length of nums and B is the number of bits (32). Space complexity is O(B) for storing bit counts.
