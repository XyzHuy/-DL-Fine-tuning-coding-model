1. Problem summary: Count the number of substrings of length three that have no repeated characters.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: String manipulation, Sliding window (implicitly).
3. Step-by-step approach: Iterate through the string, considering each substring of length three. For each substring, check if all three characters are distinct. If they are, increment a counter.
4. Edge cases: String length less than 3 (no substrings of length 3 possible).
5. Time and space complexity: Time O(n), Space O(1) because the set size is fixed at 3.
