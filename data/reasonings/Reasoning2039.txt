1. Problem summary: Calculate the earliest second when a network of servers, with server 0 as the master, becomes idle. Data servers send messages to the master, wait for a reply, and resend periodically based on their patience if no reply is received.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Graph traversal (BFS) and simulation/calculation of network idle time.
3. Step-by-step approach: First, build an adjacency list representation of the server network. Then, perform a Breadth-First Search (BFS) starting from the master server (server 0) to determine the shortest path distance to every other server. Finally, for each data server, calculate its latest message arrival time at the master and its reply return time, considering its patience for resending, and find the maximum of these times to determine when the entire network is idle.
4. Edge cases: All servers are connected, patience[0] is always 0, and patience[i] > 0 for data servers. The graph can be sparse or dense.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(E + V) for graph construction and BFS, and O(V) for calculating the idle time, where V is the number of servers and E is the number of edges. Space complexity is O(V + E) for the adjacency list and BFS queue.
