1. Problem summary: Sort a linked list where nodes are initially sorted by absolute value, but the output should be sorted by actual value.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Linked List Manipulation, In-place sorting.
3. Step-by-step approach: Iterate through the list. If a negative node is encountered, detach it and prepend it to the beginning of the list, adjusting pointers accordingly.
4. Edge cases: Empty list, list with one node, list with all positive values, list with all negative values, list where the head is negative.
5. Time and space complexity: Time O(n), Space O(1).
