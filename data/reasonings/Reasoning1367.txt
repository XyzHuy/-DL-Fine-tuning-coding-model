1. Problem summary: Check if a linked list's values form a downward path within a binary tree.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Tree traversal (DFS), Linked List traversal.
3. Step-by-step approach: Traverse the binary tree using DFS. At each node, initiate a separate DFS check to see if the linked list starts from that tree node. The linked list check also uses DFS and moves down the tree and the list simultaneously.
4. Edge cases: Empty linked list (always true), empty tree (always false), single node tree/list.
5. Time and space complexity: Time O(N * L), Space O(H) where N is number of nodes in tree, L is length of linked list, H is height of tree.
