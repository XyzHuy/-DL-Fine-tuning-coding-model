1. Problem summary: Find the maximum sum of values between nodes equidistant from the start and end of a singly linked list with an even number of nodes.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Linked List manipulation, Two Pointers, Reversing a Linked List.
3. Step-by-step approach: Use slow and fast pointers to find the middle of the list. Reverse the second half of the list. Iterate from the head and the start of the reversed second half simultaneously, calculating sums and tracking the maximum.
4. Edge cases: The problem guarantees an even number of nodes and at least two nodes, so no empty or odd-length lists.
5. Time and space complexity: O(N) time complexity for traversing and reversing, O(1) space complexity as reversal is in-place.
