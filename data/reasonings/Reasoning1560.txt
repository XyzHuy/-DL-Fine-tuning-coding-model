1. Problem summary: The problem asks to find the most frequently visited sectors on a circular track of n sectors, given a sequence of rounds specifying start and end sectors for each round.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: This is a simulation or counting problem, which can be simplified by observing patterns in circular traversal.
3. Step-by-step approach: The solution efficiently identifies the sectors visited in the final round's traversal without simulating all rounds. It considers two cases: when the start sector is less than or equal to the end sector (direct traversal) and when it's greater (traversal wraps around).
4. Edge cases: The primary edge case is when the traversal wraps around the circular track (start sector > end sector). The solution correctly handles this by combining the ranges from the start sector to n and from 1 to the end sector. The constraints guarantee valid inputs.
5. Time and space complexity: The solution runs in O(N) time due to list creation and O(N) space for storing the result, where N is the number of sectors.
