1. Problem summary: Convert a string of digits and '#' into lowercase English letters based on specific encoding rules ('1'-'9' for 'a'-'i', '10#'-'26#' for 'j'-'z').
2. Problem type / algorithm category: String manipulation, greedy approach.
3. Step-by-step approach: Iterate through the string from left to right. Check if the current character and the next two form a two-digit code ending in '#'. If so, decode the two digits and advance the pointer by 3. Otherwise, decode the single digit and advance the pointer by 1. Append the decoded character to the result.
4. Edge cases: The input string's length is at least 1. The input is guaranteed to be valid and result in a unique mapping.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(N) where N is the length of the string, as we iterate through it once. Space complexity is O(N) for the result string storage.
