1. Problem summary: Calculate the minimum fatigue cost to input a target cooking time in seconds into a microwave, considering initial finger position, movement cost, and push cost.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Simulation, Brute Force (over possible time representations).
3. Step-by-step approach: Determine valid minute/second pairs that sum to targetSeconds, considering the microwave's 4-digit input format. For each valid pair, construct the 4-digit string. Calculate the cost to input this string starting from startAt, considering moveCost and pushCost. Return the minimum cost found.
4. Edge cases: Target seconds might be exactly divisible by 60 (no seconds, only minutes). Minutes can be up to 99, seconds up to 99. The input can be one, two, three, or four digits, which are then normalized.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(1) because there are at most two valid ways to represent the target time. Space complexity is O(1) as we store a constant number of time strings.
