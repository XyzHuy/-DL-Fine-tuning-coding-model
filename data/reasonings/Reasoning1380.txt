1. Problem summary: Find all numbers in a matrix that are the minimum in their row and the maximum in their column.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Matrix Traversal, Set Operations.
3. Step-by-step approach: First, find the minimum value for each row. Second, find the maximum value for each column. Third, find the intersection of these two sets of values to identify the lucky numbers.
4. Edge cases: The problem constraints indicate a non-empty matrix with distinct elements, so no empty matrix or duplicate elements to handle. The matrix dimensions are within limits.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(m*n) for iterating through the matrix to find row minimums and column maximums. Space complexity is O(m + n) to store row minimums and column maximums.
