1. Problem summary: Given an undirected tree, a list of proposed parent-child relationships (guesses), and an integer k, find the number of nodes that can be the root such that at least k guesses are correct.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Graph Traversal (DFS), Re-rooting Technique.
3. Step-by-step approach: Build an adjacency list for the tree. Calculate the number of correct guesses if an arbitrary node (e.g., node 0) is the root using a DFS. Then, use a second DFS (re-rooting) to efficiently calculate the number of correct guesses for every other node as the root by adjusting the count based on the guessed edge direction change when moving the root.
4. Edge cases: The tree has at least 2 nodes. The number of correct guesses k can be 0 or up to the total number of guesses. The input guarantees a valid tree structure and that guesses correspond to tree edges.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(N + G), where N is the number of nodes and G is the number of guesses, due to building the graph and two DFS traversals. Space complexity is O(N + G) for storing the graph and the guess set.
