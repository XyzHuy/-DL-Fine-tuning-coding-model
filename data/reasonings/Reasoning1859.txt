1. Problem summary: Reconstruct an original sentence from its shuffled version, where each word has its 1-indexed position appended.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: String manipulation and sorting.
3. Step-by-step approach: Split the shuffled sentence into words, extract the number from each word to determine its original position, place the word (without the number) into a new list at that position, and finally join the words in the new list with spaces.
4. Edge cases: The problem statement guarantees between 2 and 9 words, so an empty or single-word sentence is not an edge case here. The numbers are guaranteed to be 1-9.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(N) where N is the length of the input string, due to splitting, iterating, and joining. Space complexity is O(N) for storing the split words and the reordered words.
