1. Problem summary: Partition a string into the maximum number of parts such that each character appears in at most one part. Return a list of the sizes of these parts.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: String manipulation, greedy algorithm.
3. Step-by-step approach: Find the last occurrence of each character in the string. Iterate through the string, maintaining the end of the current partition as the maximum last occurrence of characters seen so far. When the current index reaches the end of the partition, add the partition's size to the result and start a new partition.
4. Edge cases: Empty string, string with only one character, string where all characters are the same.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(n) because we iterate through the string twice. Space complexity is O(1) because the dictionary storing last occurrences will store at most 26 characters, which is constant.
