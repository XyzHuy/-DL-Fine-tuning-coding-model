1. Problem summary: Determine if all characters in a given string have the same frequency of appearance.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Frequency Counting, Hash Map.
3. Step-by-step approach: Count the occurrences of each character using a hash map. Then, collect all the counts into a set and check if the size of the set is one.
4. Edge cases: The problem constraints state s.length is at least 1, so an empty string is not a concern. All characters are lowercase English letters.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(N) for iterating through the string and O(1) for set operations since the alphabet size is constant. Space complexity is O(1) as the hash map and set will store at most 26 entries.
