1. Problem summary: Count how many devices are tested given an array of battery percentages, where testing a device decrements the battery of subsequent devices.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Simulation, Iteration.
3. Step-by-step approach: Iterate through the batteryPercentages array. If a device's battery is greater than 0, increment the tested device count and decrement the battery of all subsequent devices by 1, ensuring they don't go below 0.
4. Edge cases: Devices with initial battery percentage of 0 are never tested. Batteries can become 0 and stay 0. The array can have only one element.
5. Time and space complexity: Time O(n^2) due to nested loops. Space O(1) as we modify the input array in place.
