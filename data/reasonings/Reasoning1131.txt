1. Problem summary: Given two integer arrays arr1 and arr2 of equal length, find the maximum value of |arr1[i] - arr1[j]| + |arr2[i] - arr2[j]| + |i - j| for all possible i and j.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Array manipulation, absolute value, optimization.
3. Step-by-step approach: Analyze the absolute value expression to remove absolute value signs by considering all possible sign combinations. There are 8 possible combinations of signs for the three absolute value terms. For each combination, calculate the maximum and minimum values and update the overall maximum difference.
4. Edge cases: The problem statement indicates that 2 <= arr1.length == arr2.length <= 40000, and -10^6 <= arr1[i], arr2[i] <= 10^6, so there are no specific edge cases to handle beyond the given constraints.
5. Time and space complexity: The time complexity is O(n) because we iterate through the array a constant number of times (8 times). The space complexity is O(1) as we are only using a few variables to store the maximum and minimum values.
