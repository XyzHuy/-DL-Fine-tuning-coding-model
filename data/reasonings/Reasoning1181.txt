1. Problem summary: Combine phrases where the last word of the first phrase matches the first word of the second phrase, and return the distinct combined phrases in lexicographical order.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: String manipulation, hash maps, merging.
3. Step-by-step approach: Create two hash maps: one mapping the first word of each phrase to the phrase's index and the phrase itself, and the other mapping the last word of each phrase to the phrase's index and phrase itself. Iterate through the first word map, and if a first word exists as a last word in the last word map, check all possible combinations of phrases where the indices are different. Combine the matching phrases, add them to a set to ensure uniqueness, and then sort the set lexicographically and return as a list.
4. Edge cases: Overlapping phrases (i != j), phrases that result in the same combined phrase, phrases where the combined phrase is the same as one of the original phrases.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(N^2 * M * log(N)) where N is the number of phrases and M is the maximum length of the phrases (due to string concatenation and set insertion/lookup), dominated by nested loops and sorting. Space complexity is O(N*M) to store the hash maps and the set of result strings.
