1. Problem summary: Given a list of words from an alien language, determine the order of the letters based on the lexicographical order of the words. If the order is invalid, return an empty string.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Topological sort / Graph problem
3. Step-by-step approach: Build a graph representing the order of the letters. Use topological sort to find the order of the letters. Detect cycles in the graph, and return "" if a cycle is found.
4. Edge cases: Empty input, invalid order (cycle in the graph), words with different lengths, and cases where one word is a prefix of another but appears later in the list.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(V+E) where V is the number of unique letters and E is the number of edges. Space complexity is O(V+E) to store the graph and indegree array.
