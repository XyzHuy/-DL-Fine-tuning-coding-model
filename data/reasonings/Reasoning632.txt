1. Problem summary: Given k sorted lists, find the smallest range [a, b] that includes at least one number from each list.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Sliding window, sorting, and hash map (Counter).
3. Step-by-step approach: Flatten the lists into a sorted array of (value, list_index) tuples. Use a sliding window to iterate through the sorted array, maintaining a count of lists included in the window. When the window contains at least one element from each of the k lists, shrink the window from the left, updating the smallest range if necessary.
4. Edge cases: Empty input lists, lists with duplicate values. The algorithm handles these cases correctly due to the sorting and Counter object.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(N log N) due to sorting, where N is the total number of elements in all lists. Space complexity is O(N) to store the flattened sorted array and the Counter object.
