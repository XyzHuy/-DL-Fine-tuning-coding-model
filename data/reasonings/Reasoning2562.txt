1. Problem summary: Calculate a concatenation value by repeatedly taking the first and last elements of an array, concatenating them as strings, converting back to an integer, and adding to a total. If only one element remains, add its value.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Iterative processing, string manipulation, two-pointer approach.
3. Step-by-step approach: Initialize a concatenation value to 0. While the array is not empty, check its length. If greater than 1, remove the first and last elements, convert them to strings, concatenate, convert back to an integer, and add to the total. If only one element remains, add its value to the total and remove it.
4. Edge cases: An array with a single element initially. An array where elements are single digits.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(N*L) where N is the number of elements and L is the average number of digits in an element, due to string conversions. Space complexity is O(1) besides input storage.
