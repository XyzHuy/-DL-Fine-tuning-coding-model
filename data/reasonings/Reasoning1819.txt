1. Problem summary: The problem asks to find the number of unique greatest common divisors (GCDs) that can be formed from all possible non-empty subsequences of a given array of positive integers.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Number Theory, GCD, Iteration.
3. Step-by-step approach: Iterate through all possible GCD values from 1 up to the maximum number in the input array. For each potential GCD `g`, check if there exists a subsequence whose GCD is exactly `g`. This can be done by checking multiples of `g` present in the input array and calculating their GCD. If the calculated GCD of these multiples equals `g`, then `g` is a valid GCD.
4. Edge cases: The input array can contain duplicate numbers. The smallest possible GCD is 1. The maximum possible GCD is the largest number in the input array.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(M * log(M) + N), where M is the maximum value in nums, and N is the length of nums. Space complexity is O(N) for storing the unique numbers in a set.
