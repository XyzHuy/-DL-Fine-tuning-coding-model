1. Problem summary: Count pairs (x, y) where 1 <= x <= n and 1 <= y <= m, such that Alice wins a flower-picking game.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Combinatorics, Game Theory (simplified).
3. Step-by-step approach: Analyze winning conditions based on parity. Alice wins if the total number of flowers picked to end the game is odd. This occurs if one direction has an odd number of flowers and the other has an even number. Calculate combinations of odd/even counts for n and m and sum relevant cross-products.
4. Edge cases: The problem states 1 <= n, m, so ranges are always valid. The logic covers all possible parities.
5. Time and space complexity: O(1) time as it involves simple arithmetic operations, O(1) space to store a few variables.
