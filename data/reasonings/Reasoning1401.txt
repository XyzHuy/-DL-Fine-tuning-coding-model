1. Problem summary: Determine if a given circle intersects with an axis-aligned rectangle.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Geometry, Closest Point Calculation.
3. Step-by-step approach: Find the point within the rectangle that is closest to the circle's center, then calculate the squared distance between the circle's center and this closest point, and finally compare this squared distance with the squared radius.
4. Edge cases: The closest point calculation implicitly handles cases where the circle's center is inside, outside, or on the boundary of the rectangle. No explicit checks for these are needed beyond the core logic.
5. Time and space complexity: O(1) time and O(1) space.
