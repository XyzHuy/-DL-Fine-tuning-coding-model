1. Problem summary: Convert a fraction (numerator/denominator) to a string representation, handling repeating decimal parts by enclosing them in parentheses.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Math, string manipulation, hash table (for detecting repeating remainders).
3. Step-by-step approach: Handle sign, integer part, and fractional part separately. Use a dictionary to track remainders and their positions. If a remainder repeats, insert parentheses.
4. Edge cases: Numerator is zero, no fractional part (denominator divides numerator evenly), very large integers.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(N) where N is the length of the repeating decimal. Space complexity is O(N) due to the dictionary storing remainders.
