1. Problem summary: Find the maximum XOR value between a query integer xi and any number in nums that is less than or equal to a given limit mi, for multiple queries. If no numbers in nums satisfy the condition, the result is -1.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Trie (Prefix Tree) with offline query processing.
3. Step-by-step approach: Sort nums. Sort queries by their mi values, preserving original indices. Iterate through sorted queries. For each query, add eligible numbers from sorted nums (those <= mi) into a Trie. Then, query the Trie to find the maximum XOR value with xi. Store results and return in original query order.
4. Edge cases: When no elements in nums are less than or equal to mi for a query, the Trie might be empty or not contain suitable paths, resulting in -1. This is handled by checking Trie state and returning -1.
5. Time and space complexity: Time: O(N log N + Q log Q + (N+Q) * L), Space: O(N * L), where N is nums length, Q is queries length, and L is the number of bits (32). Sorting nums is O(N log N), sorting queries is O(Q log Q). Trie operations take O(L) per number or query.
