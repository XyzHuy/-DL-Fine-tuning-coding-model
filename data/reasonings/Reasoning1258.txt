1. Problem summary: Generate all possible sentences by replacing words with their synonyms, considering transitive synonym relationships, and return them lexicographically sorted.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Graph traversal (DFS/BFS for finding connected components) and backtracking (for generating combinations).
3. Step-by-step approach: 1. Build a graph where nodes are words and edges represent direct synonymy. 2. Use DFS/BFS to find connected components (sets of all equivalent words). 3. For each word in the input text, if it has synonyms, recursively explore all possible synonym substitutions. 4. Concatenate the chosen synonyms at each step to form complete sentences. 5. Sort the resulting sentences lexicographically.
4. Edge cases: Sentences with no synonyms, words not present in the synonym list, empty synonym list, empty text.
5. Time and space complexity: Time: O(N * D + W * C * log(C)), where N is the number of synonym pairs, D is the maximum depth of DFS, W is the number of words in the text, and C is the maximum number of synonyms for a word. Space: O(N + W * C).
