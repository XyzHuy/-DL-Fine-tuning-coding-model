1. Problem summary: Maximize the weighted sum of k disjoint subarrays chosen from an array, where weights are alternating and depend on the subarray's order and k.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Dynamic Programming with state compression (implicitly through transitions).
3. Step-by-step approach: Use DP where dp[i][j][0] represents the max strength using j subarrays considering first i elements without ending a subarray at index i, and dp[i][j][1] represents max strength ending a subarray at index i. Iterate through the array and number of subarrays, updating DP states by considering either extending the current subarray or starting a new one. The weights applied to subarray sums alternate and depend on j and k.
4. Edge cases: When k=1, only one subarray is chosen. Array can contain negative numbers. k is guaranteed to be odd.
5. Time and space complexity: O(n*k) time complexity and O(n*k) space complexity, though space can be optimized to O(k) since current row only depends on previous.
