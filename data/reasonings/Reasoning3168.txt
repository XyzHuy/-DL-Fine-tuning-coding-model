1. Problem summary: Determine the minimum number of chairs required to accommodate people entering and leaving a waiting room based on a sequence of 'E' (enter) and 'L' (leave) events.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Simulation, Greedy.
3. Step-by-step approach: Iterate through the input string, maintaining a count of current people in the room. Increment for 'E' and decrement for 'L'. Keep track of the maximum value this count reaches, as this represents the minimum chairs needed.
4. Edge cases: The string length is at least 1 and at most 50. The string consists only of 'E' and 'L'. The sequence is valid, meaning no one tries to leave if the room is empty (implicitly handled by `current_chairs` not going below zero if the problem guarantees validity).
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(N) where N is the length of the string, as we iterate through it once. Space complexity is O(1) as we only use a few variables to store counts.
