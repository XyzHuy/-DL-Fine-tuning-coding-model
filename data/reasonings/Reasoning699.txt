1. Problem summary: We are given a list of squares falling onto the x-axis, and we need to return the maximum height after each square falls.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Interval overlap, simulation.
3. Step-by-step approach: Iterate through the squares, calculate the height of the current square by checking for overlaps with previously dropped squares. Update the maximum height seen so far after dropping each square.
4. Edge cases: No overlapping squares, squares completely contained within other squares, squares partially overlapping.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(n^2) due to the nested loop for overlap checking. Space complexity is O(n) to store the heights of dropped squares.
