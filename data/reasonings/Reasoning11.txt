1. Problem summary: Find two lines in the given array `height` that form a container with the x-axis, such that the container holds the maximum amount of water.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Two Pointers.
3. Step-by-step approach:
    - Initialize two pointers, `left` and `right`, at the beginning and end of the array, respectively.
    - Calculate the area formed by the lines at `left` and `right` and update the `max_area`.
    - Move the pointer pointing to the shorter line inward.
    - Repeat until `left` and `right` meet.
4. Edge cases: Array of size 2.
5. Time and space complexity: Time: O(n), Space: O(1).
