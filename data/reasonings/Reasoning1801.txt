1. Problem summary: Process a sequence of buy and sell orders, matching them against a backlog and adding unmatched orders to the backlog. Return the total remaining orders modulo 10^9 + 7.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Heap (Priority Queue) based order matching.
3. Step-by-step approach: Use a max-heap for buy orders and a min-heap for sell orders. For a buy order, try to match with the cheapest available sell order. For a sell order, try to match with the most expensive available buy order. Add remaining unmatched orders to their respective heaps. Sum all amounts in both heaps at the end.
4. Edge cases: Empty input orders list. Large amounts and prices. Cases where all orders are matched or no orders are matched.
5. Time and space complexity: Time O(N log N) where N is the number of orders, due to heap operations. Space O(N) in the worst case for storing orders in heaps.
