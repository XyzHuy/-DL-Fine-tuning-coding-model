1. Problem summary: Count pairs (i, j) with i < j such that the sum of hours[i] and hours[j] is a multiple of 24.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Brute Force, Iteration, Pairwise checking.
3. Step-by-step approach: Iterate through all possible pairs of indices (i, j) where i < j. For each pair, calculate the sum of hours[i] and hours[j]. Check if this sum is divisible by 24. If it is, increment a counter. Finally, return the total count.
4. Edge cases: The input array can have a minimum of 1 element, meaning no pairs can be formed. The problem constraints ensure positive integers for hours.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(n^2) due to nested loops iterating through all pairs. Space complexity is O(1) as only a constant amount of extra space is used for variables.
