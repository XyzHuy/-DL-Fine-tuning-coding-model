1. Problem summary: Determine if a valid path exists from the top-left to the bottom-right cell in a grid, following predefined street connections in each cell.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Graph traversal, Breadth-First Search (BFS).
3. Step-by-step approach: Use BFS starting from (0,0). For each cell, explore valid connected neighbors based on its street type. A neighbor is valid if it's within bounds, not visited, and its street connects back to the current cell.
4. Edge cases: Grid dimensions of 1x1, paths that get stuck before reaching the destination, starting cell not connected to any path.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(m*n) because each cell is visited at most once. Space complexity is O(m*n) in the worst case for the queue and visited set.
