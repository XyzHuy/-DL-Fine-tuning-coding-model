1. Problem summary: Merge nodes in a linked list separated by zeros. Consecutive zeros delimit segments whose intermediate node values are summed into a single node. The first and last nodes are zeros.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Linked List Traversal and Manipulation.
3. Step-by-step approach: Use a dummy node to build the result list. Iterate through the input list, accumulating node values. When a zero is encountered, create a new node in the result list with the accumulated sum and reset the sum. Skip the zero nodes themselves.
4. Edge cases: The problem guarantees the list starts and ends with 0, and no consecutive zeros, simplifying handling. The initial dummy node handles the start of the result list.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(N) as each node is visited once. Space complexity is O(1) if we modify in-place or O(M) for the new list where M is the number of merged nodes. The provided solution uses O(M) for a new list.
