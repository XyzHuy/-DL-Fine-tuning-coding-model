1. Problem summary: Multiply two complex numbers represented as strings and return the result in the specified string format.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: String parsing, arithmetic operations.
3. Step-by-step approach: Parse the real and imaginary parts from the input strings. Perform complex number multiplication (real part: a*c - b*d, imaginary part: a*d + b*c). Format the result as "real+imaginaryi".
4. Edge cases: None specified other than constraints which say inputs are valid.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(1) as the operations are constant time. Space complexity is O(1) since only a few variables are used.
