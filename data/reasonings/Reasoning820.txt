1. Problem summary: Given an array of words, find the length of the shortest reference string that encodes all the words.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: String manipulation, sorting.
3. Step-by-step approach: Reverse the words, sort them lexicographically, then iterate through the sorted reversed words, adding the length of a word plus 1 (for the '#') to the total length if it's not a prefix of the next word.
4. Edge cases: Empty input list, single word input, words that are prefixes of each other.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is dominated by sorting, O(N log N), where N is the number of words. Space complexity is O(N) to store the reversed words.
