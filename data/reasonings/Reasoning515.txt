1. Problem summary: Given a binary tree, find the largest value in each level/row of the tree and return these values as a list.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Tree traversal / Breadth-First Search (BFS).
3. Step-by-step approach: Perform a level-order traversal of the tree using a queue. For each level, iterate through all nodes at that level and maintain the maximum value encountered. After processing each level, add the maximum value to the result list.
4. Edge cases: Empty tree (root is None). Handle cases where node values could be negative.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(N), where N is the number of nodes in the tree (we visit each node once). Space complexity is O(W), where W is the maximum width of the tree (the maximum number of nodes at any level), due to the queue.
