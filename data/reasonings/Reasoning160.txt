1. Problem summary: Find the intersection node of two singly linked lists, if one exists; otherwise, return null.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Linked list, two pointers.
3. Step-by-step approach: Use two pointers, one for each linked list. Move each pointer to the next node. If a pointer reaches the end of its list, redirect it to the head of the other list. The intersection point will be found when the two pointers are equal.
4. Edge cases: Empty lists, no intersection. The lists might have different lengths.
5. Time and space complexity: O(m+n) time, O(1) space, where m and n are the lengths of the two lists.
