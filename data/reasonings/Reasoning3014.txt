1. Problem summary: Remap telephone keys (2-9) to distinct lowercase letters to minimize total key pushes for typing a given word with distinct letters.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Greedy Algorithm / Combinatorial Optimization.
3. Step-by-step approach: Distribute letters to keys greedily. Map the first 8 most frequent (or simply the first 8 letters in any order since all letters are distinct) to 1 push, the next 8 to 2 pushes, and so on. Calculate the total pushes by summing up the pushes for each letter based on its group.
4. Edge cases: Word length can be less than or equal to 8, between 8 and 16, etc. The number of letters can perfectly fill groups of 8 or leave a remainder.
5. Time and space complexity: Time O(1) as word length is at most 26 and calculations are constant time. Space O(1) as only a few variables are used.
