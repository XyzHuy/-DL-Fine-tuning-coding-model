1. Problem summary: Given a string, find the minimum insertions of 'a', 'b', or 'c' to make it a concatenation of "abc" multiples.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Greedy approach, String manipulation.
3. Step-by-step approach: Iterate through the input string, keeping track of the expected character in the "abc" sequence. If the current character in the string does not match the expected character, increment the insertion count and update the expected character until it matches. After processing each character from the input string, advance the expected character. Finally, account for any remaining characters needed to complete the last "abc" sequence.
4. Edge cases: An empty input string (though constraints state length >= 1), a string that is already valid, and strings that require significant insertions.
5. Time and space complexity: O(N) time complexity where N is the length of the word, as we iterate through the word once. O(1) space complexity as we only use a few variables to keep track of the state.
