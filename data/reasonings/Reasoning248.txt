1. Problem summary: Count the number of strobogrammatic numbers within a given range [low, high].
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Backtracking, number generation.
3. Step-by-step approach: Generate all possible strobogrammatic numbers within the length range of low and high, and then check if each generated number falls within the specified range.
4. Edge cases: Leading zeros need to be handled when generating numbers. Numbers must be within the low and high bounds.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is difficult to determine precisely but is related to the number of strobogrammatic numbers generated which grows exponentially with length. Space complexity is also related to the number of generated numbers.
