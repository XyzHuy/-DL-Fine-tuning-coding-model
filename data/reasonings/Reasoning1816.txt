1. Problem summary: Truncate a given sentence string `s` to include only the first `k` words.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: String manipulation, Array slicing.
3. Step-by-step approach: Split the sentence by spaces into a list of words, select the first `k` words from this list, and then join them back together with single spaces.
4. Edge cases: `k` is always valid and within the number of words. Sentence has no leading/trailing spaces and words are single-space separated.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(N) where N is the length of the string `s` due to splitting and joining. Space complexity is O(N) to store the list of words.
