1. Problem summary: Determine if an array can be split into four subarrays with equal sums, given constraints on the indices that define the splits.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Array manipulation, prefix sums, searching.
3. Step-by-step approach: Calculate prefix sums to efficiently compute subarray sums. Iterate through possible values of j. For each j, iterate through possible values of i and store the sum of the first subarray in a set. Then, iterate through possible values of k and check if the sums of the four subarrays are equal and if the sum of the first subarray is present in the set.
4. Edge cases: If the array length is less than 7, it is impossible to find valid indices, return false.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(n^3) in the worst case due to the nested loops for i, j, and k. Space complexity is O(n) for the prefix sum array and O(n) in the worst case for the set `seen_sums`.
