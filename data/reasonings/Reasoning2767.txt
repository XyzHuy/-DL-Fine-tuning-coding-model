1. Problem summary: Partition a binary string into the minimum number of substrings, where each substring is a binary representation of a power of 5 and does not have leading zeros.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Dynamic Programming, String manipulation.
3. Step-by-step approach: Precompute powers of 5 that can be represented as binary strings up to the maximum length constraint. Use dynamic programming where dp[i] stores the minimum partitions for the prefix of length i. Iterate through all possible split points j for each i, and if the substring s[j:i] is a valid power of 5 and has no leading zero, update dp[i] using dp[j].
4. Edge cases: Strings starting with '0' cannot be beautiful. If no valid partition exists, return -1. The constraint on string length is small (up to 15).
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(N^3 * log(max_val)) due to DP transitions and substring checks/conversions. Space complexity is O(N + P) where P is the number of precomputed powers of 5.
