1. Problem summary: Determine if array arr can be transformed into array target by reversing any number of subarrays.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Array manipulation, Sorting, Frequency Counting.
3. Step-by-step approach: The key insight is that reversing subarrays allows arbitrary reordering of elements. Thus, if arr can be transformed into target, they must contain the exact same elements with the exact same frequencies. This can be checked by sorting both arrays and comparing them, or by using frequency maps.
4. Edge cases: Empty arrays (constraint states length >= 1), arrays with duplicate elements.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is dominated by sorting, which is O(N log N) where N is the length of the arrays. Space complexity is O(1) if sorting in-place, or O(N) if a new sorted array is created.
