1. Problem summary: Find the largest palindrome that is the product of two n-digit numbers, and return it modulo 1337.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Number theory, palindrome generation, brute force with optimization.
3. Step-by-step approach: Generate potential palindromes by concatenating a number with its reverse. Check if the palindrome can be formed by multiplying two n-digit numbers. Iterate downwards from the largest possible n-digit number.
4. Edge cases: n = 1 should return 9. The constraints guarantee a solution exists, so no need to handle cases where no palindrome is found.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is approximately O(10^(2n)), where n is the input digit number. Space complexity is O(1).
