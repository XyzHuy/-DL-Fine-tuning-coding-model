1. Problem summary: Find the maximum dot product of two non-empty subsequences of equal length from given arrays nums1 and nums2.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Dynamic Programming.
3. Step-by-step approach: Use a 2D DP table where dp[i][j] stores the maximum dot product considering nums1[0...i-1] and nums2[0...j-1]. For each pair (nums1[i-1], nums2[j-1]), consider taking the product, extending a previous dot product, or skipping elements from either array.
4. Edge cases: All numbers could be negative, requiring the selection of the least negative product. DP table initialization with negative infinity handles cases where no positive products can be formed.
5. Time and space complexity: O(m*n) for both time (iterating through DP table) and space (storing DP table), where m and n are lengths of nums1 and nums2 respectively.
