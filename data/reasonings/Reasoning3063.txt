1. Problem summary: Count the occurrences of each distinct element in a linked list and return a new linked list containing these counts.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Hash Map (Dictionary) / Linked List Traversal.
3. Step-by-step approach: Iterate through the input linked list, storing the frequency of each element's value in a hash map. Then, iterate through the values of the hash map (the frequencies) and construct a new linked list where each node's value is one of these frequencies.
4. Edge cases: An empty input linked list (though constraints state at least 1 node), or a linked list with only one distinct element.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(N) for traversing the list and O(D) for iterating through distinct elements (where D is the number of distinct elements, D <= N), resulting in O(N). Space complexity is O(D) for storing frequencies in the hash map.
