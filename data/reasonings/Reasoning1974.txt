1. Problem summary: Calculate minimum time to type a word on a circular keyboard starting from 'a', where each move and type takes 1 second.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Greedy algorithm, simulation.
3. Step-by-step approach: Initialize current character to 'a' and total time to 0. For each character in the word, calculate the shortest distance (clockwise or counterclockwise) between the current character and the target character on the circular keyboard. Add this distance plus 1 (for typing) to the total time. Update the current character to the target character.
4. Edge cases: Single character word. The circular nature of the keyboard means moving from 'z' to 'a' or 'a' to 'z' is efficient.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(N) where N is the length of the word, as we iterate through the word once. Space complexity is O(1) as we only use a few variables.
