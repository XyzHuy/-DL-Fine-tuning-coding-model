1. Problem summary: Find the minimum number of positive integers ending in digit k that sum up to num.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Greedy approach, Number theory.
3. Step-by-step approach: Iterate through possible set sizes (1 to 10). For each size 'i', check if 'i * k' has the same units digit as 'num' and if 'i * k' is less than or equal to 'num'. The first 'i' that satisfies these conditions is the minimum size.
4. Edge cases: num is 0 (result is 0), k is 0 (num must be a multiple of 10).
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(1) because the loop runs at most 10 times. Space complexity is O(1).
