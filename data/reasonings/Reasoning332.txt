1. Problem summary: Given a list of flight tickets, reconstruct the itinerary starting from "JFK" and using all tickets exactly once. If multiple itineraries exist, return the lexicographically smallest one.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Graph traversal, Depth-First Search (DFS), Eulerian path.
3. Step-by-step approach: Build an adjacency list (graph) from the tickets. Sort the destination airports for each departure airport in lexical order. Perform a DFS starting from "JFK". During the DFS, visit all neighbors (destinations) of the current city in lexicographical order and remove the edge. After visiting all neighbors of a city, add the city to the itinerary. Reverse the itinerary to obtain the correct order.
4. Edge cases: The input guarantees at least one valid itinerary exists. The same destination can be reached multiple times from the same departure, requiring edge removal to avoid cycles or infinite loops.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(ElogE) where E is the number of edges (tickets) due to sorting. Space complexity is O(E) for storing the graph.
