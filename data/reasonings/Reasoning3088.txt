1. Problem summary: Rearrange a given even-length string to make it an anti-palindrome (s[i] != s[n-i-1]) while ensuring it's lexicographically smallest. Return "-1" if impossible.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: String manipulation, greedy algorithm, sorting.
3. Step-by-step approach: Sort the string. Check if the two middle characters are the same; if so, try to swap to break palindromic structure. Then, iterate through the first half and swap characters with the second half if they violate the anti-palindrome condition, prioritizing lexicographically smaller swaps.
4. Edge cases: Impossible to form an anti-palindrome if too many characters are identical, especially in the middle or if swaps cannot resolve conflicts.
5. Time and space complexity: O(N log N) time due to sorting, O(N) space for the sorted list/string.
