1. Problem summary: Maximize profit by buying stocks within a budget, where each stock can be bought at most once, given current and future prices.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Dynamic Programming (0/1 Knapsack variation).
3. Step-by-step approach: Calculate potential profits for each stock, filter for profitable ones, sort them by purchase cost, and use DP to find the optimal combination of stocks within the budget.
4. Edge cases: No profitable stocks, budget too low to buy any profitable stock, all stocks have negative profit.
5. Time and space complexity: Time O(N log N + N*B), Space O(B) where N is the number of stocks and B is the budget.
