1. Problem summary: Convert a given integer into its base 7 representation as a string.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Number conversion / Base conversion.
3. Step-by-step approach: Handle the zero case, determine if the number is negative, convert the absolute value to base 7 by repeatedly taking the modulo and dividing by 7, and prepend the negative sign if necessary.
4. Edge cases: Zero, positive numbers, negative numbers.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(log7(abs(num))), and space complexity is O(log7(abs(num))) due to the string construction.
