1. Problem summary: Determine if it's possible to reach the last index of a binary string starting from index 0, following specific jump rules and only landing on '0's.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Dynamic Programming, Sliding Window.
3. Step-by-step approach: Initialize a DP array to track reachability. Iterate through the string, maintaining a count of reachable indices within the current jump window. An index is reachable if it's a '0' and there's at least one reachable index in the valid preceding jump range.
4. Edge cases: The target index (last index) being '1' immediately means it's unreachable. The first index is always reachable.
5. Time and space complexity: O(N) time complexity due to a single pass through the string, and O(N) space complexity for the DP array.
