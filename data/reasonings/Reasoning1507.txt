1. Problem summary: Convert a date string from "Day Month Year" format (e.g., "20th Oct 2052") to "YYYY-MM-DD" format.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: String manipulation and mapping.
3. Step-by-step approach: Split the input string into day, month, and year. Process the day to get its numeric form and pad with a leading zero if needed. Use a dictionary to map the month abbreviation to its two-digit numeric representation. Concatenate the year, processed month, and processed day into the desired "YYYY-MM-DD" format.
4. Edge cases: The problem guarantees valid input, so no explicit error handling for invalid dates or formats is required. The day number might be single-digit and needs zero-padding.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(1) as the input size is fixed and operations are constant time. Space complexity is O(1) due to fixed-size data structures like the month map.
