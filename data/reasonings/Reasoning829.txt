1. Problem summary: Find the number of ways to represent a given integer n as the sum of consecutive positive integers.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Mathematical problem, number theory.
3. Step-by-step approach: Iterate through possible lengths (k) of consecutive sequences. For each length, check if there exists a starting number (x) that makes the sum equal to n. This involves solving the equation kx + k(k-1)/2 = n for x, and ensuring x is a positive integer.
4. Edge cases: Ensure that the starting number x remains positive, meaning n - k(k-1)/2 > 0. The loop terminates when k(k-1)/2 >= n, as x would become non-positive.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(sqrt(n)) because the loop condition k * (k - 1) // 2 < n implies k is bounded by sqrt(2n). Space complexity is O(1) as we only use constant extra space.
