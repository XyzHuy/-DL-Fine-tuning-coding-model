1. Problem summary: Find the shortest sequence of 'A' (accelerate) and 'R' (reverse) instructions to reach a target position starting from position 0 and speed 1.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Breadth-First Search (BFS). This is a shortest path problem on a state space.
3. Step-by-step approach: Use BFS to explore possible positions and speeds. Start with the initial state (0, 1). In each step, explore accelerating ('A') and reversing ('R'). Keep track of visited states to avoid cycles. The first time the target position is reached, return the number of steps. Limit the search space to avoid infinite loops.
4. Edge cases: The target can be positive. Negative target values are not allowed based on the problem description (constraint 1 <= target <= 10^4), but the car can have negative positions. The search is bounded to `0 < new_pos < 2 * target` to prevent the search space from expanding indefinitely without reaching the target.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(target * log(target)), as the BFS explores positions up to approximately 2 * target, and for each position, the speed can grow logarithmically. Space complexity is O(target * log(target)) to store the visited states in the queue and visited set.
