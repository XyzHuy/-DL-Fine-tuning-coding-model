1. Problem summary: Minimize character deletions in a string to satisfy the condition that the frequency difference between any two characters is at most k.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Greedy, Frequency Analysis, Optimization.
3. Step-by-step approach: 1. Count character frequencies. 2. Sort these frequencies. 3. Iterate through each frequency as a potential minimum frequency. For each potential minimum, calculate deletions needed by reducing frequencies greater than (minimum + k) and removing characters with frequencies less than the minimum. 4. Keep track of the minimum total deletions.
4. Edge cases: Empty string (not possible by constraints), string with only one distinct character, k=0.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is dominated by counting frequencies and sorting them (O(N + A log A)), where N is word length and A is alphabet size (26). Space complexity is O(A) for storing frequencies.
