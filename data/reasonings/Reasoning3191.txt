1. Problem summary: Given a binary array, find the minimum operations to make all elements 1, where an operation flips three consecutive elements. Return -1 if impossible.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Greedy approach.
3. Step-by-step approach: Iterate through the array. If an element is 0, perform an operation on it and the next two elements to make the current element 1, and count the operation. After the loop, check if the last two elements are 1.
4. Edge cases: Array length is less than 3 (not possible due to constraints), and the last two elements cannot be made 1.
5. Time and space complexity: O(N) time and O(1) space.
