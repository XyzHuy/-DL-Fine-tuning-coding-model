1. Problem summary: Determine if a given string contains all 26 lowercase English alphabet letters.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: String manipulation, Set usage.
3. Step-by-step approach: Convert the input sentence into a set of its unique characters. Check if the size of this set is exactly 26.
4. Edge cases: The problem constraints guarantee a sentence length of at least 1 and it only contains lowercase English letters, so no empty string or invalid character handling is needed beyond the standard logic.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(N) where N is the length of the sentence due to set creation. Space complexity is O(1) because the maximum size of the set is limited to 26 distinct characters.
