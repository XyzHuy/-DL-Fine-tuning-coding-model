1. Problem summary: Find the minimum cost to travel from a start point to a target point in a 2D plane, considering direct travel (Manhattan distance) and a set of special roads with given costs.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Graph traversal, specifically Dijkstra's algorithm on an implicit graph.
3. Step-by-step approach: Model the problem as a graph where points are nodes and direct travel or special roads are edges. Use Dijkstra's algorithm with a priority queue to find the shortest path from the start to the target. The nodes in the graph include the start point, the target point, and all start and end points of special roads.
4. Edge cases: The target can be reached directly without using any special roads. The start and target points might coincide. Special roads might be bidirectional or have zero cost.
5. Time and space complexity: Let N be the number of special roads. The number of nodes in the graph is at most 2*N + 2. The number of edges is at most (2*N + 2)^2. Time complexity is O(E log V) where V is the number of vertices and E is the number of edges, which can be approximated as O(N^2 log N). Space complexity is O(V) for storing distances, which is O(N).
