1. Problem summary: Find the three largest distinct sums of elements forming rhombus shapes within a given grid. Return them in descending order, or all distinct sums if fewer than three exist.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Grid traversal, brute-force search with optimization, heap (priority queue).
3. Step-by-step approach: Iterate through each cell as a potential center of a rhombus. For each cell, consider rhombuses of increasing side lengths. Calculate the sum of elements for each valid rhombus. Store these sums in a min-heap of size at most 3, ensuring only distinct sums are kept. Finally, extract elements from the heap and sort them in descending order.
4. Edge cases: Grid dimensions can be small (1x1). Rhombus can have zero area (single cell). All rhombus sums might be identical. Fewer than three distinct rhombus sums exist.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(m*n*min(m,n)^2) for calculating sums, and O(N log K) where N is the total number of possible rhombuses and K=3 for heap operations. Space complexity is O(K) for the heap and O(N) for the set of unique sums.
