1. Problem summary: Minimize seconds to fill cups of three types (cold, warm, hot) given required amounts, by filling two different types or one type per second.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Greedy approach, optimization.
3. Step-by-step approach: Sort the amounts. If the sum of the two smallest is less than or equal to the largest, the answer is the largest amount. Otherwise, it's the ceiling of the total sum divided by two.
4. Edge cases: One or two amounts are zero. All amounts are equal.
5. Time and space complexity: O(1) time due to fixed array size, O(1) space.
