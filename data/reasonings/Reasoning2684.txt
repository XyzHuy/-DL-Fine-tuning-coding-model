1. Problem summary: Find the longest path in a grid starting from any cell in the first column, moving only to cells in the next column with strictly greater values.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Dynamic Programming with Depth First Search (DFS) or Memoization.
3. Step-by-step approach: Use DFS with memoization. For each cell, recursively explore possible next moves (up-right, right, down-right) to cells with greater values. Store the maximum moves from a cell to avoid recomputation. The final answer is the maximum of these DFS results starting from each cell in the first column.
4. Edge cases: Grids where no moves are possible from the first column (all adjacent cells in the next column have smaller or equal values). Grids with only one column (although constraints state n >= 2).
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(m*n) because each cell is visited and computed at most once due to memoization. Space complexity is O(m*n) for the DP table and recursion stack.
