1. Problem summary: Determine if all indices in an array are traversable between each other, where traversability is defined by having a greatest common divisor (GCD) greater than 1 between the numbers at those indices.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Graph connectivity, Union-Find data structure.
3. Step-by-step approach: Use Union-Find to group indices that share common prime factors. Map numbers to their prime factors and union the index with the corresponding prime factor's node. Finally, check if all original indices belong to the same connected component.
4. Edge cases: An array with a single element is always traversable. The presence of '1' in the array makes traversal impossible to/from it if other numbers exist, thus returning false.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is dominated by prime factorization and Union-Find operations, roughly O(N * sqrt(M) + N * alpha(N+M)), where N is array length and M is max value. Space complexity is O(N + M) for Union-Find and prime factor storage.
