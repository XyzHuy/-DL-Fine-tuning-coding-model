1. Problem summary: Given a list of direct paths between cities, find the city that has an incoming path but no outgoing path.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Graph traversal / Hash Set.
3. Step-by-step approach: Collect all cities that are starting points of a path into a set. Then, iterate through all the destination cities. The first destination city that is not present in the set of starting cities is the final destination.
4. Edge cases: A single path with two cities, where the second city is the destination. The problem guarantees exactly one destination and no loops.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(N) for creating the set and O(N) for iterating through paths, resulting in O(N) where N is the number of paths. Space complexity is O(N) to store the starting cities in a set.
