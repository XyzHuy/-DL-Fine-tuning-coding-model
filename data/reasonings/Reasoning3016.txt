1. Problem summary: The task is to find the minimum number of key presses required to type a given word by remapping letters to telephone keys (2-9). Each key can be mapped to a distinct set of letters, and the number of presses for a letter depends on its position within a key's mapping.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Greedy algorithm, Frequency analysis, Optimization.
3. Step-by-step approach: Count the frequency of each character in the input word. Sort the characters by their frequency in descending order. Iterate through the sorted characters, assigning the most frequent characters to the first available slots on keys. The cost for each character is its frequency multiplied by the number of presses (1 for the first 8 most frequent, 2 for the next 8, and so on).
4. Edge cases: The word can contain up to 10^5 lowercase English letters. All letters are guaranteed to be lowercase English letters.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(N log N) due to sorting characters by frequency, where N is the number of unique characters (at most 26). Space complexity is O(N) for storing character frequencies.
