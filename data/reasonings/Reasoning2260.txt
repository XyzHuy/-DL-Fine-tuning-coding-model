1. Problem summary: Find the smallest window of consecutive cards that contains at least one pair of identical cards.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Sliding window, Hash Map.
3. Step-by-step approach: Iterate through the cards, maintaining a map of card values to their last seen index. If a card is encountered that has been seen before, calculate the distance between the current index and its last seen index, updating the minimum distance if this new distance is smaller. Update the last seen index for the current card.
4. Edge cases: If no pair of matching cards is found after checking all cards, return -1. The array could have a length of 1 or contain all unique elements.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(n) because we iterate through the array once. Space complexity is O(n) in the worst case, if all card values are unique and stored in the hash map.
