1. Problem summary: Given a board of characters and a list of words, find all words from the list that can be formed on the board by traversing adjacent cells (horizontally or vertically) without revisiting the same cell.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Trie, Depth First Search (DFS), Backtracking.
3. Step-by-step approach: Build a Trie from the given words. Iterate through each cell of the board and initiate a DFS search if the Trie contains the character in that cell. The DFS explores adjacent cells, checking for valid word extensions in the Trie. If a word is found, add it to the result and mark it to avoid duplicates.
4. Edge cases: Empty board, empty word list, words not present on the board, board containing characters not in the words.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(M * N * 4^L), where M is the number of rows, N is the number of columns, and L is the maximum length of a word. Space complexity is O(W * K), where W is the number of words and K is the average length of the words (for the Trie).
