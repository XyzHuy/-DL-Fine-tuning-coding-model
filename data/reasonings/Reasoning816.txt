1. Problem summary: Given a string s representing ambiguous coordinates, find all possible valid coordinate pairs that could have generated s.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: String manipulation, backtracking/combinations.
3. Step-by-step approach: Remove parentheses. Split the string into two parts. For each part, generate all valid numbers (with or without a decimal point). Combine valid left and right numbers to create coordinate pairs.
4. Edge cases: Leading zeros are not allowed unless the number is zero itself, trailing zeros after the decimal point are not allowed, and a decimal point must have digits on both sides.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(N^3) where N is the length of the string, due to the nested loops and string generation in the make function. Space complexity is O(N^2) for storing the intermediate results and the final output.
