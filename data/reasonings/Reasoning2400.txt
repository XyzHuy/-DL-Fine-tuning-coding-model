1. Problem summary: Find the number of ways to reach endPos from startPos in exactly k steps on an infinite number line, modulo 10^9 + 7.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Combinatorics, Dynamic Programming (implied by problem structure, but solved combinatorially).
3. Step-by-step approach: Calculate the absolute distance between startPos and endPos. Determine if it's possible to reach the destination in k steps by checking parity and distance constraint. If possible, calculate the number of right steps required. The problem reduces to choosing how many of the k steps are "right" steps, which is a combination calculation C(k, right_steps).
4. Edge cases: If the absolute difference between startPos and endPos is greater than k, or if the parity of (k - distance) is odd, it's impossible to reach.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is dominated by the combination calculation, which is O(k) if implemented iteratively, or potentially O(1) with optimized math. Space complexity is O(1).
