1. Problem summary: Sort a given singly linked list in ascending order.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Divide and conquer, merge sort, linked list manipulation.
3. Step-by-step approach: Recursively divide the list into two halves, sort each half using merge sort, and then merge the two sorted halves. The middle of the linked list is found using the slow and fast pointer approach.
4. Edge cases: Empty list, list with only one element.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(n log n) due to the merge sort algorithm. Space complexity is O(log n) due to the recursive calls.
