1. Problem summary: Find the smallest index `i` in `nums` where `i` modulo 10 equals the value at `nums[i]`. Return -1 if no such index exists.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Linear scan, simple iteration.
3. Step-by-step approach: Iterate through the array `nums` from index 0 to the end. For each index `i`, check if `i % 10` is equal to `nums[i]`. If a match is found, immediately return `i` as it's the smallest such index. If the loop completes without finding a match, return -1.
4. Edge cases: The problem constraints guarantee `nums.length` is at least 1 and `nums[i]` is between 0 and 9. The main edge case is when no index satisfies the condition, which is handled by returning -1 after the loop.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(n) because we iterate through the array once. Space complexity is O(1) as we only use a few variables for iteration and comparison.
