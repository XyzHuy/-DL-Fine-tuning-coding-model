1. Problem summary: The problem asks if an array of even length can be divided into pairs such that the sum of elements in each pair is divisible by k.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Frequency counting, remainder properties, greedy approach.
3. Step-by-step approach: Calculate the remainder of each number when divided by k. Store the frequency of each remainder. For remainder 0, its count must be even. For any other remainder r, its count must equal the count of k-r.
4. Edge cases: Array length is even. Negative numbers in the array (handled by modulo operator). Remainder k (which is 0 mod k).
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(N) due to iterating through the array once and then through the remainders. Space complexity is O(K) to store the remainder counts.
