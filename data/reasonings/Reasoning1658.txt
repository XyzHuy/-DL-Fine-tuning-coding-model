1. Problem summary: Find the minimum number of operations (removing from left or right) to make the sum of removed elements equal to x.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Subarray sum, prefix sums, sliding window.
3. Step-by-step approach: Calculate the total sum of the array. The problem is equivalent to finding the longest subarray whose sum is (total_sum - x). If such a subarray exists, the answer is the total length minus the length of this subarray. Use a hash map to store prefix sums and their indices to efficiently find subarrays with the target sum.
4. Edge cases: The target sum (total_sum - x) might be 0, meaning we need to remove all elements. The target sum might not be achievable by any subarray. The target sum might be negative, implying it's impossible.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(n) because we iterate through the array once. Space complexity is O(n) in the worst case for the hash map to store prefix sums.
