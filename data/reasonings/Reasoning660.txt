1. Problem summary: Find the nth number in a sequence where numbers containing the digit 9 are removed.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Number conversion / Base conversion
3. Step-by-step approach: Convert the given number n to base 9 and then interpret the result as a base 10 number.
4. Edge cases: The input n can be 1.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(log n) and space complexity is O(log n).
