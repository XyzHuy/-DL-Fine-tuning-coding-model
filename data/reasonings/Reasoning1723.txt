1. Problem summary: Minimize the maximum total time assigned to any single worker when distributing jobs among k workers.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Dynamic Programming with Bitmasking.
3. Step-by-step approach: Precompute the sum of job times for all possible subsets of jobs using bitmasks. Then, use a DP state dp(mask, workers) representing the minimum possible maximum workload for 'workers' workers given the jobs represented by 'mask'. The transition involves iterating through all possible subsets for the current worker and recursively solving for the remaining jobs and workers.
4. Edge cases: k = 1 (all jobs to one worker), k = n (each job to a different worker), jobs list is empty (not possible by constraints), all jobs have same time.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(3^n * k) due to iterating through subsets and DP states. Space complexity is O(2^n) for storing precomputed subset sums and DP states.
