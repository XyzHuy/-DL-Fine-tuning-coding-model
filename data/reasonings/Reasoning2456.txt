1. Problem summary: Identify creators with the highest total views and their respective most-viewed video (smallest ID in case of ties).
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Hash map (dictionary) based aggregation and tracking, string manipulation (lexicographical comparison).
3. Step-by-step approach: Use two dictionaries: one to sum views per creator, another to track the best video (max views, then lexicographically smallest ID) for each creator. Iterate through videos, updating both dictionaries. Find the max total views, then filter creators matching this max, retrieving their best video ID.
4. Edge cases: Creators with the same highest popularity; videos with the same highest view count for a single creator (lexicographical tie-breaking).
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(N) where N is the number of videos, due to single pass. Space complexity is O(C) where C is the number of unique creators, for storing creator data.
