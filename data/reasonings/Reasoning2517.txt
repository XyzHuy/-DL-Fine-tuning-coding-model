1. Problem summary: Find the maximum possible minimum difference between any two candy prices in a chosen basket of k distinct candies from a given list of candy prices.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Binary Search on Answer, Greedy.
3. Step-by-step approach: Sort the prices. Use binary search on the possible range of tastiness (0 to max price difference). For a given tastiness, check greedily if k candies can be picked such that each pair has at least that tastiness. The `can_pick_k_candies` function picks the first candy, then iterates through the sorted prices, picking the next candy if its price difference from the last picked candy is at least the target tastiness. If k candies can be picked, try for a higher tastiness; otherwise, reduce the target tastiness.
4. Edge cases: All prices are the same (tastiness is 0). The minimum k is 2, so there will always be at least one pair to compare.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(N log N) for sorting and O(N log(max_price)) for binary search, where N is the number of candies and max_price is the maximum possible price difference. Space complexity is O(1) or O(N) depending on the sort implementation.
