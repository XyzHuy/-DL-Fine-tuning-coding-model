1. Problem summary: Determine the number of super-palindromes within a given range [left, right], where a super-palindrome is a number that is both a palindrome and the square of a palindrome.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Number theory, palindrome checking, generating palindromes.
3. Step-by-step approach: Generate potential palindrome roots up to 10^5 because their squares must be less than 10^18. Square each generated palindrome and check if the square is within the given range [left, right] and if it's also a palindrome. Count the valid superpalindromes.
4. Edge cases: The input numbers can be as large as 10^18 - 1. Special care needs to be taken when generating the palindromes to avoid exceeding the integer limit.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(sqrt(R)), where R is the right bound of the range. The space complexity is O(sqrt(R)) to store the generated palindromes.
