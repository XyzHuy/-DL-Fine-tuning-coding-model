1. Problem summary: Given an array of unique integers greater than 1, count the number of binary trees that can be formed where each non-leaf node's value is the product of its children's values. The same number can be used multiple times.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Dynamic Programming
3. Step-by-step approach: Sort the input array. Initialize a dictionary dp to store the number of trees that can be formed with each number as the root. Iterate through the sorted array and for each number, iterate through the previous numbers to check if they are factors. If a number is a factor, and the corresponding right child exists in the array, update the dp value for the current number by adding the product of the dp values of the left and right children. Finally, return the sum of all dp values modulo 10^9 + 7.
4. Edge cases: The array can contain large numbers, so the result must be moduloed. The input array elements are unique and greater than 1.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(N^2), where N is the length of the input array. Space complexity is O(N) for the dp dictionary.
