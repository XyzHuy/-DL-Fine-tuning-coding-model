1. Problem summary: Find the minimum operations to get k consecutive black blocks by changing 'W' to 'B'.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Sliding Window.
3. Step-by-step approach: Iterate through all possible windows of size k. For each window, count the number of 'W's, which represents the operations needed for that window. Keep track of the minimum count found.
4. Edge cases: If k is 1, the minimum operations will be 0 if there's any 'B', or 1 if all are 'W'. The problem constraints ensure k is at least 1 and at most n.
5. Time and space complexity: O(n*k) time due to slicing and counting within the loop, O(k) space for the slice. Optimized to O(n) time and O(1) space by using a sliding window without re-counting.
