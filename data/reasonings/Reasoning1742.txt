1. Problem summary: Given a range of ball numbers (lowLimit to highLimit), assign each ball to a box based on the sum of its digits. The goal is to find the box with the most balls.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Counting, Simulation, Hash Map (Dictionary).
3. Step-by-step approach: Iterate through each ball number. For each number, calculate the sum of its digits to determine the box number. Use a hash map to store the counts of balls for each box number. Finally, find the maximum value (ball count) in the hash map.
4. Edge cases: The input constraints are within reasonable bounds (1 to 10^5), so no extreme edge cases like empty ranges or extremely large numbers are expected. The minimum sum of digits for a ball number will be 1, and the maximum sum of digits for 10^5 is 9 (for 99999).
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(N*K) where N is the range (highLimit - lowLimit + 1) and K is the maximum number of digits in highLimit. Space complexity is O(M) where M is the number of unique box sums, which is at most 46 (max sum for 99999).
