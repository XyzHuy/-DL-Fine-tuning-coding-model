1. Problem summary: The goal is to find the minimum number of elements to remove from an array to make it a "mountain array," which has a strictly increasing part followed by a strictly decreasing part, with at least three elements.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Dynamic Programming, specifically related to Longest Increasing Subsequence (LIS) and Longest Decreasing Subsequence (LDS).
3. Step-by-step approach: First, calculate the length of the Longest Increasing Subsequence ending at each index (LIS). Second, calculate the length of the Longest Decreasing Subsequence starting at each index (LDS). For each index, if it can be a peak (LIS > 1 and LDS > 1), calculate the potential mountain array length (LIS[i] + LDS[i] - 1) and find the maximum possible mountain length. The minimum removals will be the total length minus this maximum mountain length.
4. Edge cases: The problem guarantees that a mountain array can be formed, so we don't need to worry about impossible cases. The definition of a mountain array requires a length of at least 3, and the peak must not be at the start or end of the array. This is handled by checking lis[i] > 1 and lds[i] > 1 and iterating from index 1 to n-2.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(n^2) due to the nested loops for calculating LIS and LDS. Space complexity is O(n) to store the LIS and LDS arrays.
