1. Problem summary: Given nums1 and nums2, where nums2 is derived from nums1 by removing two elements and adding a constant x to the rest, find the minimum possible value of x.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Brute force with optimization, Sorting.
3. Step-by-step approach: Sort both arrays. Iterate through the first three elements of nums1 as potential starting points for alignment with nums2. For each chosen element from nums1, calculate a potential x. Then, simulate the transformation by checking if all elements in nums2 can be matched to transformed elements in nums1, allowing for at most two mismatches (representing the removed elements). Keep track of the minimum valid x.
4. Edge cases: The problem guarantees that a solution exists. The constraint on array lengths and element values is standard.
5. Time and space complexity: O(N log N) for sorting, O(N) for the checking function, leading to an overall O(N log N) time complexity. Space complexity is O(1) if sorting is in-place, or O(N) depending on the sorting implementation.
