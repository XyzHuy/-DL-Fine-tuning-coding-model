1. Problem summary: Simulate memory allocation second by second, decrementing the larger memory stick, until neither stick has enough memory for the current second's allocation.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Simulation, Greedy Approach.
3. Step-by-step approach: Initialize time counter `i` to 1. In a loop, compare `memory1` and `memory2`. Allocate `i` bits to the stick with more memory (or `memory1` if equal), if it has enough. If not, the program crashes, return `[i, memory1, memory2]`. Increment `i` and repeat.
4. Edge cases: Initial memory values can be 0. One or both memory sticks might not have enough memory for the first second (i.e., `i=1`).
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(sqrt(M)) where M is the total initial memory, as the memory consumed grows quadratically. Space complexity is O(1).
