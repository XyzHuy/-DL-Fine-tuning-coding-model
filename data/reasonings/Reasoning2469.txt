1. Problem summary: Convert a given Celsius temperature (float rounded to two decimal places) into Kelvin and Fahrenheit and return them as a list.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Basic arithmetic operations, direct conversion.
3. Step-by-step approach: Apply the given formulas: Kelvin = Celsius + 273.15 and Fahrenheit = Celsius * 1.80 + 32.00. Return the results in a list.
4. Edge cases: The input is guaranteed to be non-negative. Constraints specify 0 <= celsius <= 1000, so no special handling for extremely low or high temperatures is needed beyond the direct formulas.
5. Time and space complexity: O(1) time complexity as it involves a fixed number of arithmetic operations. O(1) space complexity as it only uses a few variables to store results.
