1. Problem summary: Calculate the bitwise OR of all possible subsequence sums from a given array of integers.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Bit manipulation, combinatorics, dynamic programming (implicit).
3. Step-by-step approach: For each bit position, count how many numbers in the input array have that bit set. If a bit is set in at least one number, it will contribute to the final OR result. We can determine the final OR by considering each bit position independently. The provided solution uses a clever counting approach to manage carries when summing subsequence sums.
4. Edge cases: An array containing only zeros, where the only possible subsequence sum is zero, resulting in an OR of zero.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(N*logM) where N is the length of nums and M is the maximum value of an element, due to iterating through bits for each number. Space complexity is O(logM) for the counter array.
