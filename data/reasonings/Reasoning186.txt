1. Problem summary: Reverse the order of words in a character array in-place, where words are separated by single spaces.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: String manipulation, in-place reversal.
3. Step-by-step approach: First reverse the entire array. Then, iterate through the array, identifying individual words (sequences of non-space characters). Reverse each word in-place.
4. Edge cases: Empty array (though constraints say at least one word exists), single-word array.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(n), where n is the length of the array, due to the reversals. Space complexity is O(1) because it's done in-place.
