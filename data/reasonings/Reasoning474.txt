1. Problem summary: Given an array of binary strings and max counts of '0's and '1's, find the size of the largest subset of strings that satisfies the '0's and '1's constraints.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Dynamic Programming, Knapsack variation.
3. Step-by-step approach: Use a 3D DP array where dp[i][j][k] stores the maximum size of a subset using the first i strings with at most j '0's and k '1's. Iterate through the strings, and for each string, either include it (if enough '0's and '1's are available) or exclude it, taking the maximum of the two options.
4. Edge cases: Empty input string array, zero m or n values.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(N * M * N) where N is the number of strings, and M and N are the maximum counts of zeros and ones respectively. Space complexity is also O(N * M * N) due to the 3D DP array.
