1. Problem summary: Calculate the sum of minimum absolute differences (powers) for all subsequences of a given length k from an integer array nums, modulo 10^9 + 7.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Dynamic Programming with Memoization (Top-Down DP) and Recursion.
3. Step-by-step approach: Sort the input array. Use a recursive function (DFS) with memoization. The state of the DFS should track the current index in nums, the index of the previously chosen element, the remaining count of elements to pick for the subsequence, and the minimum absolute difference found so far within the current subsequence. The base cases handle reaching the end of the array or forming a complete subsequence. Transitions involve either skipping the current element or including it, updating the minimum difference if it's the second element chosen.
4. Edge cases: Array with duplicate elements, k equal to n, k equal to 2, very small or very large numbers, empty subsequences.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(n^3 * k) due to DP states (n positions, n previous choices, k remaining elements, min_diff which is implicitly handled by sorting and the structure of DP). Space complexity is O(n^3 * k) for memoization table. Note: The solution provided has a slight discrepancy in its complexity analysis related to `mi`. With sorting, `mi` depends on the range but the recursive states dominate. The provided solution's complexity is closer to O(n^2 * k) after sorting, as `mi` is maintained. However, a more accurate analysis of the given code leads to O(n^2 * k) states.
