1. Problem summary: The goal is to find the minimum length of a string composed of 'a', 'b', 'c' after repeatedly removing a prefix and a suffix of the same character, provided they do not overlap.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Two pointers.
3. Step-by-step approach: Use two pointers, one starting from the left and one from the right. While the characters at the pointers are the same and the left pointer is to the left of the right pointer, advance the left pointer past all consecutive occurrences of that character and similarly move the right pointer inwards. The remaining length is the difference between the right and left pointers plus one.
4. Edge cases: The string might be empty or have only one character initially. The entire string might be removed. The prefix and suffix characters might be different from the start.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(N) because each pointer traverses the string at most once. Space complexity is O(1) as only a few variables are used.
