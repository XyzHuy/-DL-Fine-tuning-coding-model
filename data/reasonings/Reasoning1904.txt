1. Problem summary: Calculate the number of full 15-minute chess rounds played given login and logout times, considering overnight play.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Time calculation, interval counting.
3. Step-by-step approach: Convert times to minutes. Handle overnight by adding 24 hours to logout time if it's earlier. Adjust login time to the next 15-minute mark, and logout time to the previous 15-minute mark. Calculate the difference in minutes and divide by 15.
4. Edge cases: Logout time is earlier than login time (overnight play). Login or logout times falling exactly on a 15-minute boundary. No full rounds played (result is 0).
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(1) as time conversions and calculations are constant time. Space complexity is O(1) as only a few variables are used.
