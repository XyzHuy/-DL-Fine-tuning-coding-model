1. Problem summary: Find the shortest distance for a ball to travel from a start position to a destination in a maze, where the ball rolls until it hits a wall.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Graph traversal / Shortest path / Priority Queue (Dijkstra's algorithm).
3. Step-by-step approach: Use a priority queue to explore possible paths, storing the distance from the start, row, and column. At each step, roll the ball in all four directions until a wall is hit. If the new position is the destination, return the distance. If the new position hasn't been visited, add it to the priority queue with updated distance.
4. Edge cases: The ball cannot reach the destination; the start and destination are the same; the maze is empty or has only one cell.
5. Time and space complexity: Time: O(m*n*log(m*n)) where m and n are the dimensions of the maze. Space: O(m*n) for the priority queue and visited set.
