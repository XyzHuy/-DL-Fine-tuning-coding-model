1. Problem summary: Find the subarray with the largest absolute sum.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Kadane's Algorithm variation.
3. Step-by-step approach: Calculate both the maximum possible subarray sum and the minimum possible subarray sum using modified Kadane's algorithm. The result is the maximum of the absolute values of these two sums.
4. Edge cases: An empty subarray has a sum of 0, which is handled. The entire array can also be the subarray.
5. Time and space complexity: O(n) time complexity and O(1) space complexity.
