1. Problem summary: Given a linked list representing a non-negative integer, add one to the integer and return the updated linked list.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Linked List manipulation, Arithmetic operation.
3. Step-by-step approach: Reverse the linked list, add one to the least significant digit, propagate the carry, add a new node if a carry remains after processing all digits, and reverse the linked list back.
4. Edge cases: Empty list (although the problem statement specifies at least one node), carry propagating to the most significant digit, requiring a new node at the head.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(N) for reversing and traversing the list. Space complexity is O(1) as the reversal is done in place (excluding the auxiliary space used by recursion stack during the reversal).
