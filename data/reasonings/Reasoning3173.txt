1. Problem summary: Compute the bitwise OR of adjacent elements in an input array and return a new array with these results.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Array manipulation, bitwise operations.
3. Step-by-step approach: Iterate through the input array from the first element up to the second-to-last element. For each index i, perform a bitwise OR operation between nums[i] and nums[i+1]. Store this result in a new array.
4. Edge cases: The input array will always have at least two elements, so there are no concerns about empty or single-element arrays. The values of the elements are within a reasonable integer range.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(n) because we iterate through the array once. Space complexity is O(n) for the output array, which is n-1 elements.
