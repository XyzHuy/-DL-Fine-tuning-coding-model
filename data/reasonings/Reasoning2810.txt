1. Problem summary: Process a given string character by character, reversing the accumulated string whenever an 'i' is encountered, and return the final resulting string.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: String manipulation, simulation.
3. Step-by-step approach: Initialize an empty list or string builder to store the result. Iterate through the input string. If the current character is 'i', reverse the current result. Otherwise, append the current character to the result. Finally, join the result into a string.
4. Edge cases: The problem states that s.length is at least 1 and s[0] is not 'i', simplifying initial conditions. An empty input string is not possible based on constraints.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(N*L) where N is the length of the input string and L is the average length of the result at each step, due to reversals. Space complexity is O(L) for storing the result.
