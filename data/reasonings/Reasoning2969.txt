1. Problem summary: Minimize the cost to buy all fruits, where buying fruit `i` at `prices[i]` grants the next `i` fruits for free.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Dynamic Programming.
3. Step-by-step approach: Use dynamic programming where `dp[i]` represents the minimum cost to acquire the first `i` fruits. Iterate through each fruit, considering two options: either buy the current fruit `i` directly (adding `prices[i-1]` to `dp[i-1]`) or use a free offer from a previous purchase. The offer from buying fruit `j` allows getting fruits up to `j+j` for free. The DP state transition involves taking the minimum of purchasing the current fruit or using a past offer to cover it.
4. Edge cases: The array `prices` has at least one element. All prices are positive. The length of `prices` can be up to 10^5.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(n^2) and space complexity is O(n), where n is the number of fruits.
