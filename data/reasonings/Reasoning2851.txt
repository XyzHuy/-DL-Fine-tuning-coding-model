1. Problem summary: Given strings s and t of equal length n and an integer k, find the number of ways to transform s into t using exactly k suffix-to-prefix rotation operations, modulo 10^9 + 7.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Dynamic Programming with Matrix Exponentiation, String Matching (Z-algorithm).
3. Step-by-step approach:
    - Recognize that each operation is a cyclic shift.
    - Model the state transitions using a 2x2 transition matrix where state 0 is when s equals t, and state 1 is when s does not equal t.
    - The transition matrix will represent how many ways we can go from state 0 to 0, 0 to 1, 1 to 0, and 1 to 1 in one operation.
    - Use matrix exponentiation to efficiently calculate the number of ways after k operations.
    - Identify all possible cyclic shifts of s that are equal to t. This can be done using the Z-algorithm on a concatenated string like s + t + t.
    - The Z-algorithm helps find occurrences of t within shifted versions of s.
    - The final answer is a combination of the resulting counts from the matrix exponentiation, weighted by whether a specific shift results in t.
4. Edge cases: The problem constraints specify n >= 2 and k >= 1, so trivial cases like empty strings or k=0 are not applicable. The modulo operation is crucial for large results.
5. Time and space complexity: O(N + log K) time due to Z-algorithm and matrix exponentiation, and O(N) space for Z-algorithm and matrices.
