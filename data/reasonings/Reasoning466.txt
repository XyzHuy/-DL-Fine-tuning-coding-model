1. Problem summary: Given two strings s1 and s2 and two integers n1 and n2, determine the maximum integer m such that [s2, m] can be obtained from [s1, n1] where [s, n] denotes the string s repeated n times.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: String manipulation, pattern matching, cycle detection.
3. Step-by-step approach: Iterate through the repeated s1 string, keeping track of the current index in s2. When the index reaches the end of s2, increment the count of s2 repetitions. Use a hash map to store previously visited indices in s2 and their corresponding s1 and s2 counts to detect cycles. If a cycle is found, calculate the number of complete cycles that fit within n1 and adjust the counts accordingly. After the loop, divide the total count of s2 repetitions by n2 to get the maximum integer m.
4. Edge cases: Empty strings, zero repetitions. Cycle detection is crucial.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(len(s1) * n1) in the worst case without cycle detection but can be improved to O(len(s1) * len(s2)) with cycle detection. Space complexity is O(len(s2)) due to the hash map storing indices and counts.
