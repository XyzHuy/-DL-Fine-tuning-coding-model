1. Problem summary: Given a binary tree and a node x chosen by the first player, determine if the second player can choose a node y such that they can color more nodes than the first player.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Tree traversal, game theory, counting nodes in subtrees.
3. Step-by-step approach: Find the node with value x. Count the number of nodes in its left subtree, right subtree, and the remaining nodes (parent side). Check if any of these counts is greater than n/2. If any is, the second player can win.
4. Edge cases: Empty tree (handled by the `if not node` checks in the helper functions).
5. Time and space complexity: O(n) time to traverse the tree multiple times, O(h) space for the recursion stack where h is the height of the tree. In the worst case (skewed tree) h = n, so O(n) space.
