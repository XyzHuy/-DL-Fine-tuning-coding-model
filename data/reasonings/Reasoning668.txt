1. Problem summary: Find the kth smallest element in an m x n multiplication table.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Binary Search
3. Step-by-step approach: Use binary search on the range [1, m*n]. For each mid value, count the number of elements in the multiplication table that are less than or equal to mid. If the count is less than k, search in the right half; otherwise, search in the left half.
4. Edge cases: k = 1, k = m*n, m = 1, n = 1.
5. Time and space complexity: Time: O(m * log(m*n)), Space: O(1)
