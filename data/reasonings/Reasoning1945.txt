1. Problem summary: Convert a string to an integer based on letter positions, then repeatedly sum digits k times.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: String manipulation, arithmetic operations, iterative processing.
3. Step-by-step approach: First, map each character in the input string 's' to its alphabetical position (a=1, b=2, etc.) and concatenate these numbers into a single string. Then, iterate 'k' times. In each iteration, sum the digits of the current number string and convert this sum back into a string for the next iteration. Finally, convert the resulting string to an integer.
4. Edge cases: The input string 's' consists of only lowercase English letters. 'k' is a positive integer. The length of 's' is at least 1 and at most 100.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(N*K*L), where N is the length of s, K is the number of transformations, and L is the number of digits in the intermediate string which grows with N. Space complexity is O(N) for storing the intermediate number string.
