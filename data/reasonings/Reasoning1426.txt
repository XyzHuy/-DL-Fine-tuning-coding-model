1. Problem summary: Count elements x in an array where x+1 also exists in the array, treating duplicates distinctly.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Array traversal, Set usage for efficient lookups.
3. Step-by-step approach: Create a set from the input array for quick element checking. Iterate through the original array, and for each element, check if its successor (element + 1) is present in the set. If it is, increment a counter.
4. Edge cases: Empty array, array with only one element, arrays with duplicate numbers, arrays where no elements satisfy the condition.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(n) due to set creation and single array traversal. Space complexity is O(n) in the worst case for storing unique elements in the set.
