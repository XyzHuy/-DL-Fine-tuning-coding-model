1. Problem summary: Rearrange binary string bits to form the largest possible odd binary number.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: String manipulation, greedy approach.
3. Step-by-step approach: Count the total number of '1's. Construct the result by placing all '1's except one at the beginning, followed by all '0's, and finally placing the remaining '1' at the end to ensure it's odd.
4. Edge cases: The string contains only one '1'.
5. Time and space complexity: O(N) time to count '1's and construct the string, O(N) space to store the resulting string.
