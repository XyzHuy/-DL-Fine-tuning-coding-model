1. Problem summary: Determine if all 'a' characters precede all 'b' characters in a string composed only of 'a's and 'b's.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: String manipulation, Pattern matching.
3. Step-by-step approach: Iterate through the string and check if the substring "ba" exists. If "ba" is found, it implies an 'a' appears after a 'b', violating the condition.
4. Edge cases: Strings with only 'a's, strings with only 'b's, and strings with a single character.
5. Time and space complexity: O(N) time to check for the substring, O(1) space assuming the substring check doesn't create a new string.
