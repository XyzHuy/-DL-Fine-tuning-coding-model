1. Problem summary: Given an array of strings, determine the minimum number of columns to delete such that the remaining columns are lexicographically sorted from top to bottom.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Array traversal, string comparison.
3. Step-by-step approach: Iterate through each column of the input string array. For each column, check if the column is lexicographically sorted. If not, increment the deletion count. Return the deletion count.
4. Edge cases: Empty input array, single-row input array, single-column input array, already sorted array, completely unsorted array.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(n*m) where n is the number of strings and m is the length of each string. Space complexity is O(1).
