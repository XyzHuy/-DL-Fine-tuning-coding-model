1. Problem summary: Determine the earliest and latest rounds two specific players will compete in a knockout tournament, given their initial positions and the rule that they win against anyone else, while other matches have arbitrary outcomes.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Dynamic Programming with Memoization, Recursive state exploration.
3. Step-by-step approach: Define a recursive function with memoization that takes the current number of players (represented by 'k'), and the relative positions of the two target players ('l' from the front, 'r' from the end). The function calculates the minimum and maximum rounds for them to meet. The base case is when the players are adjacent or the same. The recursive step iterates through all possible pairings in the current round, considering how the players can advance to minimize or maximize their eventual meeting round.
4. Edge cases: The problem statement guarantees 2 <= n <= 28 and 1 <= firstPlayer < secondPlayer <= n, so no extreme edge cases like n=1 or invalid player numbers are expected. The case where players are initially adjacent or already in positions to compete in the first round is handled by the recursive logic.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(N^3 * 2^N) without memoization, but with memoization, the number of states is related to N^3, and each state involves a loop up to N, so it's closer to O(N^4). Space complexity is O(N^3) due to memoization table.
