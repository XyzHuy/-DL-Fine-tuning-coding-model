1. Problem summary: Given a graph and a list of initially infected nodes, determine which initial node to remove to minimize the final number of infected nodes after malware spreads through connected components.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Graph traversal, connected components (DFS), optimization.
3. Step-by-step approach: Find connected components using DFS. Count the number of initially infected nodes in each component. Iterate through the initially infected nodes; if a component contains only one infected node, calculate the size of that component. Choose the node whose removal would result in the largest decrease in infected nodes. If multiple such nodes exist, return the smallest indexed node.
4. Edge cases: Multiple nodes can be removed to minimize the spread, in which case return the smallest index. If no single node removal improves the spread, return the smallest initial node.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(N^2) due to the DFS traversal of the adjacency matrix. Space complexity is O(N) to store visited nodes, component IDs, component sizes and infection counts.
