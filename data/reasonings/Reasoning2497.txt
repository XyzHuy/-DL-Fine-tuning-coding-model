1. Problem summary: Find the maximum sum of a star graph subgraph with at most k edges, where the star sum includes the center node and its neighbors.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Graph traversal, Greedy.
3. Step-by-step approach: For each node, consider it as a potential center. Calculate the sum of its value and the k largest positive neighbor values. Keep track of the maximum sum found.
4. Edge cases: Graphs with a single node, no edges, or all negative values. k=0.
5. Time and space complexity: Time O(N*M*logM) where M is max degree, Space O(N+E).
