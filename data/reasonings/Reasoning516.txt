1. Problem summary: Find the length of the longest palindromic subsequence within a given string.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Dynamic Programming
3. Step-by-step approach: Initialize a 2D DP table where dp[i][j] stores the length of the longest palindromic subsequence in s[i:j+1]. Base case: single characters are palindromes of length 1. Iterate through substrings of increasing length. If the characters at the start and end of the substring match, extend the inner palindrome by 2. Otherwise, take the maximum length from either excluding the start or the end character.
4. Edge cases: Empty string (though constraints say at least length 1). Single character string.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(n^2) due to the nested loops. Space complexity is O(n^2) for the DP table.
