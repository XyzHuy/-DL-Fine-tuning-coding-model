1. Problem summary: Given an encoded string and an index k, find the kth character of the decoded string.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: String manipulation, reverse engineering, modulo operation.
3. Step-by-step approach: First, calculate the total length of the decoded string. Then, iterate through the encoded string in reverse. Use the modulo operator to reduce k and check if the current character is the desired one. If a digit is encountered, divide the size by that digit, and if a character is encountered, decrement the size by one.
4. Edge cases: k is 1, very large decoded string length, s starts with a letter.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(N), where N is the length of the encoded string. Space complexity is O(1).
