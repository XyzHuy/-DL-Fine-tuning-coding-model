1. Problem summary: Generate a square matrix of size n x n, filling it with numbers from 1 to n^2 in a spiral order.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Matrix manipulation, spiral traversal.
3. Step-by-step approach: Initialize a matrix with zeros. Define boundaries (top, bottom, left, right). Iterate in a spiral manner, filling the matrix with increasing numbers. Update the boundaries after each layer.
4. Edge cases: n = 1.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(n^2) because we visit each cell once. Space complexity is O(n^2) for the output matrix.
