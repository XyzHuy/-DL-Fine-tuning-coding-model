1. Problem summary: Find the minimum positive integer speed for n train rides, with given distances and total available time, considering mandatory waits for integer departure hours.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Binary Search on the Answer.
3. Step-by-step approach: First, check an impossible condition: if the number of waits (n-1) is already greater than or equal to the available hour, return -1. Otherwise, perform a binary search for the speed. For a given speed, calculate the total travel time including waits (using ceiling for each ride except the last) and check if it's within the 'hour' limit. Adjust the binary search range based on this check.
4. Edge cases: The case where it's impossible to reach on time even at maximum possible speed (specifically, if the number of required waits exceeds available time) is handled. The minimum speed is 1.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(N * log(MaxSpeed)), where N is the number of distances and MaxSpeed is the maximum possible speed (10^7). Space complexity is O(1) excluding input storage.
