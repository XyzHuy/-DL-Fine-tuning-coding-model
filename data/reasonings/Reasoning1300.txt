1. Problem summary: Find an integer 'value' such that replacing elements in 'arr' greater than 'value' with 'value' makes the sum closest to 'target'. Return the smallest 'value' in case of a tie.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Binary Search, Optimization.
3. Step-by-step approach: Define a helper function to calculate the sum for a given 'value'. Perform binary search on the possible range of 'value' (0 to max(arr)). In each step, calculate the sum and difference. Update the best 'value' if the current difference is smaller or if it's a tie and the current 'value' is smaller. Adjust the binary search range based on whether the current sum is less than or greater than 'target'.
4. Edge cases: Empty array (not possible due to constraints), array with one element, target being very small or very large, all elements being the same. The initial range of binary search covers the minimum and maximum possible values.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(N log M) where N is the length of arr and M is the maximum value in arr. Space complexity is O(1).
