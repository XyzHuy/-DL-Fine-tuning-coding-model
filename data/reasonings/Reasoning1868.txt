1. Problem summary: Multiply two run-length encoded arrays and return the result as a run-length encoded array.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Greedy approach, Two Pointers.
3. Step-by-step approach: Use two pointers to iterate through both encoded arrays. In each step, determine the common frequency between the current segments, calculate the product of their values, and append to the result. Adjust the frequencies of the current segments, advancing pointers when a segment's frequency becomes zero. Merge with the last result if values are the same.
4. Edge cases: Handling cases where one encoded array is exhausted before the other. Merging consecutive segments with the same product value.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(L1 + L2), where L1 and L2 are the lengths of the input encoded arrays. Space complexity is O(1) if we modify input arrays in-place or O(R) where R is the length of the result array, for storing the output.
