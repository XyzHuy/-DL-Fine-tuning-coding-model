1. Problem summary: Count quadruples (i,j,a,b) such that firstString[i..j] == secondString[a..b] and j-a is minimized.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: String matching, optimization.
3. Step-by-step approach: Find the first occurrence of each character in firstString and the last occurrence of each character in secondString. Iterate through common characters to find the minimum difference between their first occurrence index in firstString and last occurrence index in secondString. Count occurrences of this minimum difference.
4. Edge cases: No common characters between strings, empty strings (not possible per constraints).
5. Time and space complexity: Time O(N+M), Space O(K) where N and M are lengths of strings and K is the alphabet size.
