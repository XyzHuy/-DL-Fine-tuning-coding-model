1. Problem summary: Count pairs of servers (a, b) connectable through a central server c in a weighted tree, where distances from c to a and c to b are divisible by signalSpeed and their paths from c don't share edges.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Tree traversal, Depth First Search (DFS), combinatorics.
3. Step-by-step approach: Build an adjacency list for the tree. For each server c, perform a modified DFS from each of its neighbors to count nodes reachable at distances divisible by signalSpeed, ensuring paths don't intersect at c. Group these counts and sum up products of pairs of counts for total connectable pairs for c.
4. Edge cases: Trees with only two nodes. Signal speed of 1. All weights being large. Disconnected components are not possible as input is a valid tree.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(N^2 * N) in naive DFS for each node and its subtrees. Space complexity is O(N) for graph representation and recursion stack. The provided solution is O(N^2) as DFS is called once for each edge emanating from a center node.
