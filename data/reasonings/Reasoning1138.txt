1. Problem summary: Given a target string, find a sequence of moves (U, D, L, R, !) to spell out the target string on the alphabet board starting from (0, 0).
2. Problem type / algorithm category: String manipulation, graph traversal (implicitly).
3. Step-by-step approach: Iterate through the target string. For each character, calculate its coordinates (x, y) on the board. Move from the current position (i, j) to (x, y) using the shortest path (prioritize L and U before R and D to handle the 'z' corner case), and append the moves to the answer. Finally, append "!" to add the character to the answer.
4. Edge cases: Moving to 'z' from above requires special handling to avoid going out of bounds. The order of movements matters when approaching 'z'.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(N * M), where N is the length of the target string and M is the maximum distance between two characters on the board. Space complexity is O(K), where K is the length of the output string.
