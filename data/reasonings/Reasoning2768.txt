1. Problem summary: Count 2x2 blocks with 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 black cells in an m x n grid, given the coordinates of black cells.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Grid traversal, hashing (dictionary/map), counting.
3. Step-by-step approach: Iterate through each black cell. For each black cell at (x, y), determine the top-left corners of all 2x2 blocks that this cell belongs to (which are (x, y), (x-1, y), (x, y-1), (x-1, y-1)). Increment a counter for each valid block's top-left coordinate. Finally, count how many blocks have 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 black cells based on the collected counts.
4. Edge cases: When black cells are on the grid boundaries, they only contribute to fewer than four 2x2 blocks. The total number of blocks is (m-1)*(n-1), so blocks with zero black cells need to be calculated by subtracting.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(C), where C is the number of coordinates, as each coordinate is processed a constant number of times. Space complexity is O(C) to store the counts for each block.
