1. Problem summary: Calculate the sum of squares of numbers 'i' from 1 to 'n' where the square of 'i' can be split into partitions that sum up to 'i'.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Backtracking / Recursion, Number Theory.
3. Step-by-step approach: Iterate through each number 'i' from 1 to 'n'. For each 'i', calculate its square, convert the square to a string. Use a recursive helper function to check if the string representation of the square can be partitioned into substrings whose integer values sum up to 'i'. If it can, add i*i to the total punishment sum.
4. Edge cases: The input 'n' is a positive integer. The number 1 always satisfies the condition (1*1=1, partition is just 1, sum is 1). Single-digit squares are trivially partitioned.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is roughly O(n * 9^n) in the worst case due to the recursive partitioning of the squared number, as each digit can potentially start a new partition, and the number of digits in n^2 grows logarithmically. Space complexity is O(log(n^2)) or O(log n) due to recursion depth for partitioning.
