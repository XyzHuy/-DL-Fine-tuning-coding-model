1. Problem summary: Given a binary array, find the minimum operations to make all elements 1. An operation consists of flipping all elements from a chosen index to the end.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Greedy approach, simulation.
3. Step-by-step approach: Iterate through the array, keeping track of the current flip state. If an element's effective value (considering the current flip state) is 0, we must perform an operation starting at that index, incrementing the operation count and toggling the flip state.
4. Edge cases: The array can have all 0s, all 1s, or a mix. The logic handles these by iterating through each element.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(n) because we iterate through the array once. Space complexity is O(1) as we only use a few variables.
