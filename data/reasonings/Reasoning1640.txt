1. Problem summary: Check if an array `arr` can be formed by concatenating sub-arrays from `pieces` in their original order within each sub-array.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Array traversal, Hash Map (Dictionary) usage.
3. Step-by-step approach: Map the first element of each piece to its corresponding sub-array. Iterate through `arr`, and for each element, check if it's the start of a piece. If it is, verify if the entire piece matches the contiguous sub-array in `arr`. If a match is found, advance the `arr` index by the length of the piece. If any mismatch or element not found occurs, return false.
4. Edge cases: `arr` or `pieces` being empty (though constraints prevent this), `pieces` not containing all elements of `arr`, elements of `arr` appearing in `pieces` but not in the correct sequence.
5. Time and space complexity: Time O(N) where N is the length of `arr`, Space O(M) where M is the number of unique starting elements in `pieces`.
