1. Problem summary: Determine if a 3x3 grid of 'B' and 'W' can form a 2x2 monochrome square by changing at most one cell.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Grid traversal, brute-force check.
3. Step-by-step approach: Iterate through all four possible 2x2 subgrids. For each subgrid, count the occurrences of 'B' and 'W'. If either color count is 3 or 4, it's possible to form a monochrome 2x2 square by changing one cell.
4. Edge cases: The grid is always 3x3. The input characters are only 'B' or 'W'.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(1) because the grid size is fixed at 3x3. Space complexity is O(1) as no extra space proportional to input size is used.
