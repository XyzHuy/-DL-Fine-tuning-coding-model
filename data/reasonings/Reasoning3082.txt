1. Problem summary: Calculate the total power of all subsequences of a given array `nums`, where the power of a subsequence is defined as the count of its sub-subsequences that sum up to `k`. Return the result modulo 10^9 + 7.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Dynamic Programming, specifically a variation of the subset sum or knapsack problem.
3. Step-by-step approach: Initialize a DP table `f[i][j]` representing the sum of powers for subsequences formed using the first `i` elements that sum up to `j`. The transition involves either not including the current element (multiplying by 2 for each new subsequence created) or including it if the sum `j` is large enough.
4. Edge cases: An empty input array `nums`, `k` being 0, or no subsequence summing to `k` should be handled correctly by the DP initialization and transitions.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(n*k) due to the nested loops iterating through the DP table. Space complexity is O(n*k) for storing the DP table.
