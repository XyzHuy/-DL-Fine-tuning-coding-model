1. Problem summary: The goal is to remove the minimum number of parentheses from a string containing lowercase letters, '(' and ')' to make the remaining parentheses valid.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: String manipulation, Stack-based validation.
3. Step-by-step approach: Use a stack to track open parentheses indices. Iterate through the string: if an open parenthesis is found, push its index. If a close parenthesis is found and the stack is not empty, pop from the stack (valid pair). If a close parenthesis is found and the stack is empty, mark its index for removal. After the first pass, any indices left in the stack correspond to unmatched open parentheses, so mark them for removal too. Finally, build the new string excluding characters at the marked indices.
4. Edge cases: Empty string input, string with only letters, string with only parentheses (all valid or all invalid), string with no parentheses.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(N) due to two linear passes through the string and set/stack operations. Space complexity is O(N) in the worst case for the stack and the set of indices to remove.
