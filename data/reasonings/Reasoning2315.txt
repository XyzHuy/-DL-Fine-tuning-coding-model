1. Problem summary: Count asterisks in a string, but exclude those located between pairs of vertical bars.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: String manipulation, counting.
3. Step-by-step approach: Split the string by the vertical bar character. Iterate through the resulting segments, but only consider segments at even indices (0, 2, 4, etc.). For each of these selected segments, count the number of asterisks and add it to a running total.
4. Edge cases: The string may contain no asterisks, or no vertical bars. The problem guarantees an even number of vertical bars.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(N) where N is the length of the string, due to splitting and counting. Space complexity is O(N) in the worst case for storing the split segments.
