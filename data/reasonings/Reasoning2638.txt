1. Problem summary: Count the number of subsets of a given array of distinct integers where no two elements in the subset have an absolute difference equal to k.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Dynamic programming on subsets, graph partitioning, combinatorial counting.
3. Step-by-step approach: Group numbers into "chains" where elements are k apart. For each chain, calculate the number of k-free subsets independently using dynamic programming. Multiply the counts from all chains to get the total.
4. Edge cases: Empty input array (handled by initial count of 1), k being very large (all subsets are k-free).
5. Time and space complexity: O(N log N) time due to sorting chains, O(N) space to store chains.
