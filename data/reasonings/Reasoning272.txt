1. Problem summary: Given a BST, a target, and k, find the k values in the BST closest to the target.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Binary Search Tree, Inorder Traversal, Priority Queue (implicitly using deque).
3. Step-by-step approach: Perform an inorder traversal of the BST. Maintain a deque of size k. During traversal, if the deque is not full, add the current node's value. If the deque is full, compare the absolute difference between the current node's value and the target with the absolute difference between the deque's leftmost value and the target. If the current node is closer, remove the leftmost value and add the current node's value. Since it's inorder and a BST, if the current node is farther, stop traversing.
4. Edge cases: Empty tree, k is larger than the number of nodes. The problem statement guarantees a unique set of k closest values.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(N), where N is the number of nodes in the tree, due to the inorder traversal. Space complexity is O(k) to store the k closest values in the deque.
