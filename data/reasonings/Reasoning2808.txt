1. Problem summary: Find the minimum time to make all elements in an array equal by repeatedly replacing each element with itself or its neighbors.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Array manipulation, Breadth-First Search (implicitly), Optimization.
3. Step-by-step approach: Group indices by value, calculate the maximum distance between consecutive occurrences (including wrap-around) for each value, and find the minimum of these maximum distances divided by two.
4. Edge cases: Array with all same elements (0 seconds), array with only two distinct elements.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(N) due to iterating through the array and index map, space complexity is O(N) for the index map.
