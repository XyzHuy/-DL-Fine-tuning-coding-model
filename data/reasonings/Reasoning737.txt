1. Problem summary: Given two sentences represented as string arrays and a list of similar word pairs, determine if the two sentences are similar. Sentences are similar if they have the same length and each word at the same index are similar. Word similarity is transitive.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Graph Traversal (BFS), Similarity Detection.
3. Step-by-step approach: First, check if the sentences have the same length. If not, they are not similar. Then, construct a graph where nodes are words and edges represent similarity. Finally, for each pair of words at the same index in the two sentences, use BFS to check if they are similar in the constructed graph.
4. Edge cases: Empty sentences, empty similarity pairs, identical sentences, no similarity between words, sentences of different lengths.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(N * M * K), where N is the length of the sentences, M is the number of similar pairs, and K is the average length of a similarity chain. Space complexity is O(M) for storing the graph.
