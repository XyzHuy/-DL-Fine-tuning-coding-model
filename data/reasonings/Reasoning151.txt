1. Problem summary: Reverse the order of words in a string, removing leading/trailing/multiple spaces.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: String manipulation / Array reversal.
3. Step-by-step approach: Split the string into a list of words, reverse the list, and join the words back into a string with single spaces.
4. Edge cases: Empty input string, string with only spaces, string with leading/trailing spaces, string with multiple spaces between words.
5. Time and space complexity: Time: O(n), Space: O(n) due to the list of words.
