1. Problem summary: Determine if the number of vowels in the first half of a given even-length string equals the number of vowels in the second half.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: String manipulation, character counting.
3. Step-by-step approach: Split the string into two equal halves. Iterate through the first half, counting vowels. Simultaneously, iterate through the second half, counting vowels. Compare the two counts and return true if they are equal, false otherwise.
4. Edge cases: The problem guarantees an even length string with a minimum length of 2, so an empty string or odd length string are not valid inputs per constraints.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(N) because we iterate through half of the string once. Space complexity is O(1) as we only use a few variables for counts and a constant-size set for vowels.
