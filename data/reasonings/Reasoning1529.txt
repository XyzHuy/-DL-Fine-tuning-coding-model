1. Problem summary: Transform a binary string s (initially all zeros) into a target binary string by repeatedly flipping all bits from a chosen index to the end. Find the minimum operations.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Greedy algorithm, String manipulation.
3. Step-by-step approach: Iterate through the target string. Track the current effective state of s (whether it's currently flipped or not). When the current character in target differs from the current effective state, an operation is needed, and the effective state flips. Skip any initial zeros as they don't require an operation if s starts as all zeros.
4. Edge cases: The target string consists entirely of zeros (0 operations needed). The target string starts with ones.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(n) because we iterate through the string once. Space complexity is O(1) as we only use a few variables.
