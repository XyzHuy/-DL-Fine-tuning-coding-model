1. Problem summary: The problem describes a game played on a Fibonacci tree. Players take turns removing a node and its subtree. The player who is forced to remove the root loses. We need to determine if the first player, Alice, wins given the initial size n of the Fibonacci tree.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Game Theory, Combinatorial Game Theory, Nim Game (specifically related to Sprague-Grundy theorem implications).
3. Step-by-step approach: Analyze small values of n to find a pattern. This involves determining the winning/losing states. The game can be modeled as an impartial game, and its outcome can often be determined by a pattern related to the game's state or size. The solution suggests a modulo-based pattern emerges.
4. Edge cases: n=1 (Alice loses immediately as she must take the root), n=2, n=3. The constraints start from n=1.
5. Time and space complexity: The solution uses a simple modulo operation, which is O(1) time and O(1) space.
