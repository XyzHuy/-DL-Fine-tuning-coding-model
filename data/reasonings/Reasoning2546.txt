1. Problem summary: Determine if binary string s can be transformed into binary string target using a specific bitwise OR and XOR operation between two indices.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: String manipulation, Bitwise operations, Greedy approach.
3. Step-by-step approach: Check if string s contains at least one '1'. Check if string target contains at least one '1'. If both contain '1's, or if both are all '0's, it's possible. Otherwise, it's impossible.
4. Edge cases: Both strings are all '0's. One string has '1's and the other doesn't.
5. Time and space complexity: Time O(N) to scan strings, Space O(1).
