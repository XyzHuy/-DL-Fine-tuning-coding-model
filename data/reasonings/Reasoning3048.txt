1. Problem summary: Find the earliest time (second) by which all numbers in `nums` can be reduced to zero, allowing marking at specific `changeIndices` only when the corresponding `nums` value is zero.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Binary search on the answer, combined with a greedy checking function.
3. Step-by-step approach: Binary search for the earliest second `k`. For a given `k`, check if all indices can be marked. To check, find the last occurrence of each index in `changeIndices` within the first `k` seconds. Greedily use available decrement operations before the last occurrence of an index to reduce its value to zero. If at any point there aren't enough operations for a required decrement, or if an index doesn't appear in `changeIndices` up to `k`, then `k` is not feasible.
4. Edge cases: If an index in `nums` never appears in `changeIndices` within the given `m` seconds, it's impossible to mark. The binary search range needs careful handling, and the final result should be -1 if not all indices can be marked.
5. Time and space complexity: The time complexity is O(m log m) due to binary search and the O(m) check function. The space complexity is O(n) for storing last occurrences.
