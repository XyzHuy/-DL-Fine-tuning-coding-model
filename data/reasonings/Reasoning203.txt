1. Problem summary: Given a linked list, remove all nodes with a specific value.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Linked list manipulation.
3. Step-by-step approach: Use a dummy node to handle the head removal, iterate through the linked list, and remove nodes with the target value.
4. Edge cases: Empty list, target value at the beginning of the list, target value not present.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(n), space complexity is O(1).
