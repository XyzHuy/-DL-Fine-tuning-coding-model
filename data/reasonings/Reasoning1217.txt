1. Problem summary: Find the minimum cost to move all chips to the same position, where moving between even or odd positions is free, and moving between even and odd positions costs 1.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Array manipulation, counting, greedy algorithm.
3. Step-by-step approach: Count the number of chips at even and odd positions. The minimum cost is the minimum of these two counts.
4. Edge cases: An empty input array is not possible according to the constraints.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(n) due to iterating through the input array. Space complexity is O(1) as only two counters are used.
