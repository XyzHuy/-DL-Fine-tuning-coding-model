1. Problem summary: Determine if a given code snippet is a valid XML-like document based on specific tag, CDATA, and content rules.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: String parsing, regular expressions, stack (implicitly).
3. Step-by-step approach: Use regular expressions to iteratively remove valid CDATA sections and tags from the code string, replacing them with a placeholder. Finally, check if the remaining string consists only of placeholders.
4. Edge cases: Empty input, unbalanced tags, invalid tag names, nested tags, CDATA sections containing invalid tags.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is difficult to determine precisely due to the iterative regex substitutions, but is likely O(n^2) in the worst case where n is the length of the code string. Space complexity is O(n) due to the intermediate strings created during regex substitutions.
