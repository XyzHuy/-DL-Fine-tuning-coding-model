1. Problem summary: Determine if a path exists from (0,0) to (xCorner, yCorner) within a rectangle, avoiding given circles and touching the rectangle only at the specified corners.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Graph traversal (specifically DFS) on a representation of circle adjacencies.
3. Step-by-step approach: First, check if the start (0,0) or end (xCorner, yCorner) points are inside any circle. Then, define adjacency between circles if they overlap. Finally, use DFS to see if any circle touching the left/top boundary can reach a circle touching the right/bottom boundary.
4. Edge cases: Circles completely outside the rectangle, circles covering the start/end points, circles touching boundaries such that they block all paths.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(N^2) due to DFS exploring possible circle overlaps. Space complexity is O(N) for the visited array and recursion stack.
