1. Problem summary: Given an initial string `s` and a series of queries, each query updates a character at a specific index. After each update, the goal is to find the length of the longest substring composed of a single repeating character.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Segment Tree with lazy propagation is not used here, but a standard Segment Tree is used for range queries and point updates.
3. Step-by-step approach: Build a segment tree where each node stores information about a range of characters. This information includes the maximum length of a repeating character substring within that range, the length of the repeating prefix, the length of the repeating suffix, and the total length of the range. When a query updates a character, traverse the tree to the leaf node corresponding to the updated index, change its character, and then propagate the changes upwards by merging the information from child nodes back to their parents. After each update, query the root of the segment tree for the overall maximum repeating substring length.
4. Edge cases: The initial string could be empty or contain only one character. The queries could target the first or last characters of the string. Multiple consecutive updates might occur at the same index.
5. Time and space complexity: Building the segment tree takes O(N) time, where N is the length of the string `s`. Each query (update and retrieval) takes O(log N) time. With K queries, the total time complexity is O(N + K log N). The space complexity is O(N) for storing the segment tree.
