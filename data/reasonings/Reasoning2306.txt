1. Problem summary: Count distinct valid company names formed by swapping the first letters of two distinct ideas, provided both swapped names are not in the original list.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: String manipulation, counting, combinatorial problem.
3. Step-by-step approach: Group ideas by their starting characters. For each pair of starting characters (a, b), count how many suffixes of words starting with 'a' can be swapped with words starting with 'b' to form valid new words not in the original set. Multiply these counts and sum them up, considering both (a, b) and (b, a) swaps.
4. Edge cases: Empty input list (constrained by problem statement to have at least 2 elements), all ideas having the same suffix or identical first characters after swaps.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(N*L) where N is the number of ideas and L is the maximum length of an idea, due to iterating through ideas and performing set lookups. Space complexity is O(N*L) or O(1) depending on whether the set storage is considered relative to input size or constant alphabet size. The swap_count matrix is O(1) with respect to input size.
