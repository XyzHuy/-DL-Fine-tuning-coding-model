1. Problem summary: Count how many target words can be formed by taking a start word, appending a unique character, and then rearranging.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Bit manipulation, Set operations, String manipulation.
3. Step-by-step approach: Represent each word as a bitmask of its characters for efficient comparison. Store all start word bitmasks in a set. For each target word, iterate through its characters. For each character, create a potential start word bitmask by removing that character from the target word's bitmask. Check if this potential start word bitmask exists in the set of start words.
4. Edge cases: Empty input arrays are not possible based on constraints. Strings with single characters. Target words that are identical to start words (these cannot be formed because a character must be appended).
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(N*L + M*L), where N is the number of start words, M is the number of target words, and L is the maximum length of a word. Space complexity is O(N) to store the start word bitmasks.
