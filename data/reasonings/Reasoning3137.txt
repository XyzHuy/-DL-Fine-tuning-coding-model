1. Problem summary: The goal is to find the minimum operations to make a string k-periodic by replacing k-length substrings at indices divisible by k with other k-length substrings.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: String manipulation, frequency counting, greedy approach.
3. Step-by-step approach: Count the occurrences of each unique k-length substring. Identify the most frequent substring. The minimum operations needed is the total number of k-length segments minus the count of the most frequent segment.
4. Edge cases: String length is a multiple of k. All characters are lowercase English letters.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(N) where N is the length of the word, for iterating and hashing substrings. Space complexity is O(min(N, M*k)) where M is the number of unique k-length substrings, to store counts.
