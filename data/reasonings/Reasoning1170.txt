1. Problem summary: Given two arrays of strings, queries and words, for each query, find the number of words in the words array such that the frequency of the smallest character in the query string is less than the frequency of the smallest character in the word.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: String manipulation, frequency counting, binary search.
3. Step-by-step approach: First, define a helper function f(s) to calculate the frequency of the smallest character in a string s. Then, calculate the frequencies of the smallest characters in all words and store them in a sorted array. For each query, calculate the frequency of the smallest character and use binary search (bisect_right) to find the number of words with a larger frequency.
4. Edge cases: Empty strings, strings with only one character, strings with the same character repeated multiple times.
5. Time and space complexity: O(n log n + m*k) time, where n is the number of words, m is the number of queries, and k is the maximum length of a word or query. O(n) space for storing word frequencies.
