1. Problem summary: Minimize array length by merging adjacent elements whose product is <= k.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Greedy approach, Stack-based processing.
3. Step-by-step approach: Iterate through numbers, maintain a stack. If the current number can be merged with the top of the stack (product <= k), pop and merge, repeating until merge is not possible or stack is empty. Then push the current (or merged) number onto the stack. The final stack length is the answer.
4. Edge cases: Empty input array, and cases where no merges are possible.
5. Time and space complexity: O(N) time complexity as each number is pushed and popped at most once. O(N) space complexity for the stack in the worst case.
