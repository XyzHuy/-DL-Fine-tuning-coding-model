1. Problem summary: Determine if two strings representing rational numbers (with optional repeating decimals) are equal.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: String parsing, numerical computation.
3. Step-by-step approach: Parse the strings to separate the non-repeating and repeating parts, expand the repeating part to a certain length, convert to float, and compare the floating-point values with a tolerance.
4. Edge cases: Empty repeating part, different length of repeating parts, integer part absence, strings that represent the same number but are written differently (e.g. "0.9(9)" and "1.").
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity depends on the length to which the repeating decimals are expanded, roughly O(L) where L is the chosen expansion length. Space complexity is also O(L) for storing the expanded strings.
