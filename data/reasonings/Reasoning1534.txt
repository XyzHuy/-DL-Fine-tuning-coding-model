1. Problem summary: Count triplets (arr[i], arr[j], arr[k]) where indices i < j < k and absolute differences between elements satisfy given bounds a, b, and c.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Brute-force iteration with conditional checks.
3. Step-by-step approach: Iterate through all possible combinations of i, j, and k such that 0 <= i < j < k. For each combination, check if the absolute differences |arr[i] - arr[j]| <= a, |arr[j] - arr[k]| <= b, and |arr[i] - arr[k]| <= c. If all conditions are met, increment a counter.
4. Edge cases: The array length is at least 3, ensuring at least one triplet can be formed. Values in arr and bounds a, b, c are non-negative.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(n^3) due to three nested loops. Space complexity is O(1) as only a counter variable is used.
