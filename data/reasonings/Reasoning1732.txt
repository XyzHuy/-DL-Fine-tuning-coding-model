1. Problem summary: Calculate the highest altitude reached by a biker starting at altitude 0, given the net altitude gain between consecutive points.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Iteration, Prefix Sum.
3. Step-by-step approach: Initialize current altitude and highest altitude to 0. Iterate through the gain array, updating the current altitude by adding the gain at each step. Keep track of the maximum altitude encountered so far.
4. Edge cases: The gain array can contain negative values, leading to a decrease in altitude. The highest altitude could be 0 if all gains result in altitudes less than or equal to 0.
5. Time and space complexity: O(n) time complexity as we iterate through the gain array once. O(1) space complexity as we only use a few variables.
