1. Problem summary: Find the minimum cost to acquire all chocolate types, considering initial costs and rotation costs.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Brute force with optimization, Dynamic programming (implicitly).
3. Step-by-step approach: Iterate through all possible numbers of rotations (0 to n-1). For each rotation count, calculate the total cost by summing the cost of rotations and the minimum cost to acquire each chocolate type after those rotations. Keep track of the overall minimum cost found.
4. Edge cases: Array with one element, all costs are equal, x is very large or very small.
5. Time and space complexity: Time O(n^2) due to nested loops, Space O(n) for storing intermediate minimum costs per rotation.
