1. Problem summary: Find the minimum maximum integer such that we can assign uniqueCnt1 numbers not divisible by divisor1 to arr1 and uniqueCnt2 numbers not divisible by divisor2 to arr2, with no overlap between arr1 and arr2.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Binary Search on Answer, Number Theory (Inclusion-Exclusion Principle).
3. Step-by-step approach: Binary search for the minimum possible maximum value. For a given candidate maximum value 'mid', check if it's possible to form the sets: calculate numbers not divisible by divisor1, not divisible by divisor2, and not divisible by either (using LCM and inclusion-exclusion), and verify if these counts are sufficient for uniqueCnt1 and uniqueCnt2 respectively, while also ensuring no common elements.
4. Edge cases: The problem constraints state positive integers, so the lower bound for binary search is 1. The upper bound can be estimated to be large enough to accommodate the counts and divisors.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(log(MaxVal) * 1) because the check function takes constant time and binary search is performed on a range up to 10^10. Space complexity is O(1).
