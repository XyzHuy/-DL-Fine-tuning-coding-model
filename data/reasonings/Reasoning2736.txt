1. Problem summary: Given two arrays nums1 and nums2, and a list of queries, for each query (xi, yi), find the maximum sum nums1[j] + nums2[j] where nums1[j] >= xi and nums2[j] >= yi. If no such j exists, return -1.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: This problem is a variation of a 2D range query or a two-pointer approach combined with a data structure for efficient querying. It can be solved using a sweep-line algorithm with a persistent segment tree or by sorting and processing with a dynamically updated data structure like a monotonic stack/list.
3. Step-by-step approach: First, combine nums1 and nums2 into pairs and sort them by nums1 in descending order. Sort the queries by their xi values in descending order. Iterate through the sorted queries. For each query, add all nums1-nums2 pairs whose nums1 value is greater than or equal to the current query's xi into a data structure. This data structure should efficiently store (nums2 value, sum) pairs and allow querying for the maximum sum among pairs whose nums2 value is greater than or equal to the query's yi. A monotonic list where elements are sorted by nums2 value and decreasing sum can be maintained. For querying, use binary search.
4. Edge cases: No pairs satisfying the condition for a query (results in -1), empty input arrays or queries, all values being very large or very small. The constraints on values up to 10^9 are important.
5. Time and space complexity: Sorting pairs and queries takes O(N log N + Q log Q) where N is the length of nums1/nums2 and Q is the number of queries. The sweep-line processing with a monotonic list and binary search for each query results in O(N log N + Q log N) in total, as each element is added and potentially removed from the active list at most once. Space complexity is O(N + Q) to store pairs, sorted queries, and the result.
