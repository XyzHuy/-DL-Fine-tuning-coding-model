1. Problem summary: Count positive integers up to a given number 'num' whose digits sum to an even number.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Iteration, Number manipulation.
3. Step-by-step approach: Iterate from 1 to 'num'. For each number, calculate the sum of its digits. If the sum is even, increment a counter. Return the final count.
4. Edge cases: The input 'num' is always positive (1 <= num <= 1000). The smallest case is num=1.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(N*logN) where N is 'num' because of iteration and string conversion for digit sum. Space complexity is O(logN) for string conversion.
