1. Problem summary: Simulate visiting rooms based on visit counts to find the first day all rooms are visited.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Dynamic Programming / Simulation.
3. Step-by-step approach: Calculate the number of days to reach room i for the first time, considering the rules for transitioning between rooms. The recurrence relation accounts for returning to a previous room or moving to the next room.
4. Edge cases: The problem constraints specify n >= 2, so no need to handle n=0 or n=1. Modulo arithmetic is important for large day counts.
5. Time and space complexity: O(n) time to iterate through rooms and O(n) space to store the days needed for each room.
