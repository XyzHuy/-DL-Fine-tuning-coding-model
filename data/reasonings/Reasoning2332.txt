1. Problem summary: Determine the latest possible arrival time to catch a bus, given bus departure times, passenger arrival times, and bus capacity, ensuring no arrival at the same time as another passenger.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Greedy algorithm with sorting and two pointers.
3. Step-by-step approach: Sort buses and passengers. Iterate through sorted buses, filling them with earliest arriving passengers up to capacity. Track the last successful boarding time. If a bus has remaining capacity, the latest arrival can be at the bus departure time. Finally, adjust the latest arrival time downwards to avoid coinciding with any existing passenger arrival.
4. Edge cases: Empty passenger list, buses with full capacity, arriving exactly at a passenger's arrival time.
5. Time and space complexity: O(N log N + M log M) time due to sorting, O(M) space for the passenger set.
