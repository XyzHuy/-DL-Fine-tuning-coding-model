1. Problem summary: Find the first substring of length k in a given string s whose hash value, calculated using a specific polynomial rolling hash function with given power and modulo, matches a target hashValue.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: String searching, Polynomial Rolling Hash.
3. Step-by-step approach: Calculate the hash of the last substring of length k. Then, iterate backwards from the second-to-last potential substring start. For each step, efficiently update the hash by removing the contribution of the outgoing character and adding the contribution of the incoming character, using modular arithmetic. If a hash matches the target, record the starting index and continue searching backwards to find the first occurrence.
4. Edge cases: String length equal to k, the hash of the entire string being the target. The constraints guarantee an answer always exists.
5. Time and space complexity: O(N) time complexity for iterating through the string and calculating hashes, O(1) space complexity as only a few variables are used.
