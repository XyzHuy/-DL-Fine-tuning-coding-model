1. Problem summary: Minimize the number of work sessions to complete all tasks, where each session has a maximum duration and tasks cannot be split across sessions.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Dynamic Programming on Subsets (Bitmask DP).
3. Step-by-step approach: Precompute the sum of task times for all possible subsets of tasks. Use DP where dp[mask] stores the minimum sessions to complete tasks represented by the mask. Iterate through all masks, and for each mask, consider all valid subsets (whose total time is <= sessionTime) that can form the last session, transitioning from a smaller mask.
4. Edge cases: The problem guarantees sessionTime is greater than or equal to the maximum task time, simplifying some constraints. n is small (up to 14), allowing for exponential complexity.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(3^n) due to the subset iteration within the DP. Space complexity is O(2^n) for the DP table and subset times.
