1. Problem summary: Given a time string with some hidden digits (?), find the latest possible valid time by replacing the '?'s.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: String manipulation, greedy approach.
3. Step-by-step approach: Iterate through the time string (hh:mm) and greedily replace '?'s to maximize the time. For hours, prioritize the highest valid digit considering the existing digit. For minutes, use the highest possible digit (5 for the tens place, 9 for the units place).
4. Edge cases: The problem guarantees that a valid time can always be produced. This simplifies handling, as we don't need to backtrack or consider impossible scenarios.
5. Time and space complexity: O(1) time complexity as the input string length is fixed at 5. O(1) space complexity as we convert the string to a list of fixed size.
