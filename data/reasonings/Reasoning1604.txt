1. Problem summary: Identify workers who used their key-card three or more times within a one-hour window and return their unique names, sorted alphabetically.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Hash Map (Dictionary), Sorting, Time Series Analysis.
3. Step-by-step approach: Group access times by worker name, convert times to minutes, sort each worker's access times, and check for any three times within a 60-minute interval. Collect and sort the names of those who trigger an alert.
4. Edge cases: A worker might have fewer than three keycard uses. The one-hour window is inclusive of the start time and ends exactly 60 minutes later.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is dominated by sorting each worker's access times, O(N log N) in the worst case where N is the total number of entries. Space complexity is O(N) to store the access times.
