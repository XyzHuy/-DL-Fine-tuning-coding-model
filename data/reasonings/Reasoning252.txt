1. Problem summary: Determine if a person can attend all meetings given a list of meeting time intervals, where each interval represents the start and end time of a meeting.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Interval problem, sorting.
3. Step-by-step approach: Sort the intervals by their start times. Then, iterate through the sorted intervals and check for overlaps between consecutive intervals. If an overlap is found, return false. If no overlaps are found after checking all intervals, return true.
4. Edge cases: Empty input list, single interval, intervals with same start or end times.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(n log n) due to sorting. Space complexity is O(1) as sorting is done in place (depending on the sorting algorithm used by the language).
