1. Problem summary: Calculate the alternating sum of digits of a positive integer, starting with a positive sign for the most significant digit.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: String manipulation, arithmetic operations.
3. Step-by-step approach: Convert the integer to a string, iterate through its digits, adding even-indexed digits and subtracting odd-indexed digits from a running sum.
4. Edge cases: The input is guaranteed to be a positive integer between 1 and 10^9. Single-digit numbers are handled correctly by the logic.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(log10(n)) because the number of digits is proportional to the logarithm of n. Space complexity is O(log10(n)) due to string conversion.
