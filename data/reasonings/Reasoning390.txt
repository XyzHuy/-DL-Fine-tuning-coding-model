1. Problem summary: Determine the last remaining number after repeatedly removing elements from a sorted list of integers from 1 to n, alternating between left-to-right and right-to-left removals.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Mathematical reasoning / Simulation
3. Step-by-step approach: Simulate the removals by tracking the head (first element), step size, remaining elements, and direction. Update the head based on the direction and parity of remaining elements. Halve the remaining elements and double the step in each iteration.
4. Edge cases: n = 1 should return 1.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(log n) because the number of remaining elements is halved in each iteration. Space complexity is O(1) as it only uses a constant amount of extra space.
