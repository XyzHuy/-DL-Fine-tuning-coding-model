1. Problem summary: Calculate the sum of all node values that are at the maximum depth of a given binary tree.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Breadth-First Search (BFS) / Level Order Traversal.
3. Step-by-step approach: Perform a level order traversal. Keep track of the sum of nodes at the current level. The sum calculated for the last processed level will be the sum of the deepest leaves.
4. Edge cases: An empty tree (root is None).
5. Time and space complexity: Time O(N) where N is the number of nodes, as each node is visited once. Space O(W) where W is the maximum width of the tree, for the queue. In the worst case (a complete binary tree), W can be N/2, so O(N).
