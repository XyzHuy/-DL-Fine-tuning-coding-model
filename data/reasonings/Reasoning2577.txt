1. Problem summary: Find the minimum time to reach the bottom-right cell from the top-left cell of a grid, where each cell has a minimum time requirement to enter it. Moves to adjacent cells take 1 second.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Graph traversal, specifically Dijkstra's algorithm with a modification to handle waiting times.
3. Step-by-step approach: Use a min-heap to store (time, row, col) tuples, prioritizing smaller times. When exploring neighbors, if the current time + 1 is less than the neighbor's requirement, calculate the necessary waiting time and push it to the heap with the adjusted time. Mark visited cells. Return the time when the destination is reached.
4. Edge cases: The start cell (0,0) must have a requirement of 0. If the immediate neighbors of the start cell have requirements greater than 1, it might be impossible to move. The grid might be disconnected, making the destination unreachable.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(m*n * log(m*n)) due to heap operations. Space complexity is O(m*n) for the visited set and the heap.
