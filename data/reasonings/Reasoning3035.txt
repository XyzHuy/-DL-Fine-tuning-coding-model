1. Problem summary: The problem asks for the maximum number of palindromic strings that can be formed by swapping characters between any two strings any number of times.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Greedy, Character Frequency Analysis.
3. Step-by-step approach: Count all character frequencies globally. Distribute characters to form palindromes greedily, prioritizing shorter strings. A palindrome requires pairs of characters, and at most one character can be left unpaired (for odd length palindromes). Iteratively form palindromes using available character pairs, starting with the shortest strings, until insufficient pairs remain.
4. Edge cases: All strings are empty, all strings are single characters, all characters are distinct, all strings can form palindromes.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(N*L + U log U), where N is the number of words, L is the maximum length of a word, and U is the number of unique characters (at most 26). Space complexity is O(U) for character counts.
