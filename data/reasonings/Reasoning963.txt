1. Problem summary: Given a list of 2D points, find the minimum area of any rectangle formed by these points (not necessarily aligned with the axes). Return 0 if no such rectangle exists.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Geometry, Hashing
3. Step-by-step approach: Iterate through all pairs of points, treating them as potential diagonals. Store diagonals with the same length and midpoint in a dictionary. Then, iterate through the diagonals with the same length and midpoint. For each pair of diagonals, calculate the lengths of the sides of the potential rectangle and compute the area. Update the minimum area if a smaller area is found.
4. Edge cases: No rectangle can be formed from the given points, resulting in an area of 0. Overlapping points are not possible based on the problem description.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(N^3) because we iterate through all pairs of points to find diagonals and then iterate through pairs of diagonals. The space complexity is O(N^2) in the worst case, to store the diagonals and their midpoints.
