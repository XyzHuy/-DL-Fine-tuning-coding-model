1. Problem summary: Find the length of the longest chain of pairs, where a pair can follow another if the first pair's second element is less than the second pair's first element.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Greedy algorithm, dynamic programming (though greedy is more efficient here).
3. Step-by-step approach: Sort the pairs by their second element. Iterate through the sorted pairs and greedily select pairs that can extend the chain, updating the chain length and the end of the last selected pair.
4. Edge cases: Empty input list, pairs with overlapping intervals, all pairs can form a chain, no pairs can form a chain.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(n log n) due to sorting. Space complexity is O(1) (or O(n) depending on the sorting algorithm implementation).
