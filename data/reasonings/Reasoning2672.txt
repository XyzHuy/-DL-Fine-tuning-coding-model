1. Problem summary: Given an array of uncolored elements and a series of queries to color specific indices, update the array and count adjacent pairs of the same color after each query.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Array manipulation, simulation.
3. Step-by-step approach: Initialize an array of zeros. For each query, update the color at the specified index. Before updating, check if the new color creates or breaks adjacent pairs with its neighbors and adjust the count accordingly. Append the current count to the result list.
4. Edge cases: Array with a single element (n=1). Queries at the boundaries of the array (index 0 and n-1).
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(Q) where Q is the number of queries, as each query takes constant time. Space complexity is O(N) for storing the colors array, and O(Q) for the result array.
