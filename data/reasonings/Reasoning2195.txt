1. Problem summary: Given an array of integers and an integer k, find the sum of k unique positive integers not present in the array that minimize the total sum.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Greedy approach, Set operations.
3. Step-by-step approach: Iterate through positive integers starting from 1. For each integer, check if it's present in the input array (using a set for efficiency). If not present, add it to the result sum and decrement k. Continue until k becomes 0.
4. Edge cases: The input array might contain duplicates, large numbers, or k could be very large. The smallest positive integers might already be in nums.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(N + M) where N is the length of nums and M is the sum of the k minimal integers (can be up to O(k) in the worst case if nums are small). Space complexity is O(N) for the set.
