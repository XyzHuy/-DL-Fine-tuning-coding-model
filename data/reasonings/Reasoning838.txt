1. Problem summary: Determine the final state of dominoes after being pushed, considering forces from both left and right.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Simulation / Dynamic Programming
3. Step-by-step approach: Calculate forces from 'R' to the right, then forces from 'L' to the left. Combine forces and determine the final state based on the net force at each position.
4. Edge cases: Empty input string, string with only one type of domino ('L' or 'R' or '.'), cases where forces cancel out resulting in '.'
5. Time and space complexity: Time: O(n), Space: O(n)
