1. Problem summary: Given initial marble positions and a series of moves (from one position to another), determine the final unique occupied positions after all moves.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Set manipulation, simulation.
3. Step-by-step approach: Initialize a set with the initial marble positions. Iterate through the move operations. For each move from 'moveFrom[i]' to 'moveTo[i]', remove the 'moveFrom[i]' position from the set if it exists and add the 'moveTo[i]' position to the set. Finally, convert the set to a sorted list.
4. Edge cases: Multiple marbles at the same initial or destination position, moving marbles from a position that becomes empty due to a previous move (guaranteed by constraints).
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(N log N + M) where N is the initial number of marbles and M is the number of moves, due to set operations and sorting. Space complexity is O(N) to store the occupied positions.
