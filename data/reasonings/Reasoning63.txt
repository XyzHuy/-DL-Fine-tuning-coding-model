1. Problem summary: Given a grid with obstacles, find the number of unique paths from the top-left to the bottom-right corner, moving only down or right.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Dynamic Programming
3. Step-by-step approach: Initialize a DP table of the same size as the grid. The value at dp[i][j] stores the number of paths to reach that cell. Initialize dp[0][0] to 1 if the starting cell is not an obstacle. Fill the first row and column based on the absence of obstacles. For the rest of the table, dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j] + dp[i][j-1] if the current cell is not an obstacle. Return the value at dp[m-1][n-1].
4. Edge cases: If the starting cell is an obstacle, return 0. Empty grid is also considered as an invalid input, equivalent to the starting cell being an obstacle.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(m*n) due to iterating through the grid. Space complexity is O(m*n) to store the DP table.
