1. Problem summary: Repeatedly remove the leftmost occurrence of a given substring 'part' from a string 's' until no more occurrences exist.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: String manipulation, iterative removal.
3. Step-by-step approach: Continuously search for the substring 'part' within 's'. If found, remove its first occurrence and repeat the search on the modified 's'. Continue until 'part' is no longer present in 's'.
4. Edge cases: The string 's' or 'part' could be empty, or 'part' might not exist in 's' initially. The entire string 's' could be composed of 'part' repeated.
5. Time and space complexity: The time complexity can be O(N*M*K) in the worst case where N is the length of s, M is the length of part, and K is the number of removals. Space complexity is O(N) due to string manipulations creating new strings.
