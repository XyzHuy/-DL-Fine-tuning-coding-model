1. Problem summary: Given an array and a series of updates to its elements, for each update, calculate the maximum sum of a non-adjacent subsequence and sum these maximums modulo 10^9 + 7.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Dynamic Programming, Array updates, Modulo arithmetic.
3. Step-by-step approach: Use dynamic programming where dp[i][0] is the max sum ending at index i without including nums[i], and dp[i][1] is the max sum ending at index i including nums[i]. After each query modifies an element, recompute the DP table from that index onwards and add the overall max sum to the total.
4. Edge cases: Empty subsequence (sum 0), negative numbers in the array, updates at the beginning of the array.
5. Time and space complexity: Space is O(N) for DP arrays. Time is O(Q*N) due to recomputing DP for each query.
