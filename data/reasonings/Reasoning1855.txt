1. Problem summary: Find the maximum distance (j - i) between indices i and j of two non-increasing arrays nums1 and nums2, such that i <= j and nums1[i] <= nums2[j].
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Two pointers.
3. Step-by-step approach: Initialize two pointers, i for nums1 and j for nums2, both to 0. Iterate while both pointers are within array bounds. If nums1[i] <= nums2[j], update the maximum distance if j - i is greater, then increment j. If nums1[i] > nums2[j], it means the current nums1[i] is too large for the current nums2[j] and any subsequent nums2 values (due to non-increasing property), so increment i to try a smaller value from nums1, and also increment j to find a potentially valid pair.
4. Edge cases: No valid pairs exist, in which case the maximum distance remains 0. Arrays can be of different lengths.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(n + m) where n and m are lengths of nums1 and nums2 respectively, as each pointer traverses its array at most once. Space complexity is O(1) as only a few variables are used.
