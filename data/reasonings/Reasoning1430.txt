1. Problem summary: Determine if a given array `arr` represents a valid root-to-leaf path sequence in a binary tree, where each node's value must match the corresponding element in `arr`.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Tree Traversal, Depth-First Search (DFS).
3. Step-by-step approach: Use a recursive DFS function that takes the current node and the current index in `arr`. At each step, check if the node is valid, if the index is within bounds, and if the node's value matches `arr[index]`. If all conditions are met, recursively call DFS for the left and right children with an incremented index. The path is valid if the end of `arr` is reached and the current node is a leaf.
4. Edge cases: The tree might be empty, `arr` might be empty, or a path might not end at a leaf node when `arr` is fully traversed.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(N), where N is the number of nodes in the tree, as each node is visited at most once. Space complexity is O(H) due to the recursion stack, where H is the height of the tree.
