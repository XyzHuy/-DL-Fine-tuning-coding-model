1. Problem summary: Calculate the sum of all integers from 1 to n (inclusive) that are divisible by 3, 5, or 7.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Iteration and Basic Arithmetic.
3. Step-by-step approach: Initialize a variable to store the sum. Iterate through each number from 1 to n. For each number, check if it is divisible by 3, 5, or 7 using the modulo operator. If it is, add the number to the sum. Finally, return the accumulated sum.
4. Edge cases: The problem states n is a positive integer, so n=1 is the smallest possible input. The constraints ensure n is at most 103.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(n) because we iterate through each number up to n. Space complexity is O(1) as we only use a single variable to store the sum.
