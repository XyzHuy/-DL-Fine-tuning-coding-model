1. Problem summary: Find the length of the shortest subarray in an infinitely repeating array that sums to a given target.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Sliding Window, Number Theory (Divisibility and Remainders).
3. Step-by-step approach: Calculate the sum of the original array. Determine how many full copies of the original array are needed to reach or exceed the target sum using division and remainder. If the target is a multiple of the array sum, return the corresponding length. Otherwise, use a sliding window on a doubled version of the original array to find the shortest subarray summing to the remainder. Combine the length of the remainder subarray with the length of the full array copies.
4. Edge cases: Target sum is exactly a multiple of the array sum. No subarray sums to the target. Target sum is less than the smallest element.
5. Time and space complexity: Time O(N), Space O(N) where N is the length of nums.
