1. Problem summary: Determine if string s3 is an interleaving of strings s1 and s2.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Dynamic Programming.
3. Step-by-step approach: Check if the lengths sum up correctly. Use a 1D DP array to store if a prefix of s3 can be formed by interleaving prefixes of s1 and s2. Iterate through s1 and s2, updating the DP array based on character matches with s3.
4. Edge cases: Empty strings, length mismatches between s1+s2 and s3.
5. Time and space complexity: Time: O(m*n), where n and m are the lengths of s1 and s2. Space: O(m), where m is the length of s2.
