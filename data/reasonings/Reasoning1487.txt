1. Problem summary: Generate unique folder names from a given list, appending a counter in parentheses if a name is a duplicate.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Hashing and String Manipulation.
3. Step-by-step approach: Iterate through names. If a name is new, use it and record its count as 1. If a name exists, increment a counter `k` and form `name(k)`, checking for its uniqueness until a new name is found. Store the generated unique name and update counts for both original and new names.
4. Edge cases: All names are duplicates. Names with existing parentheses. Empty input list.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity O(N*L), Space complexity O(N*L) where N is number of names and L is max length of a name due to string operations and hash map storage.
