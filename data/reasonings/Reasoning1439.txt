1. Problem summary: Find the kth smallest sum formed by picking one element from each row of a given matrix where rows are sorted.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Heap-based sorting or merging, generalized merge k sorted lists, or binary search on the answer. The provided solution uses a merging/iterative approach.
3. Step-by-step approach: Start with the sums from the first row. Iteratively, for each subsequent row, combine the current list of smallest sums with the elements of the next row, keeping only the k smallest resulting sums. This is done by generating all possible sums and then sorting/truncating to k.
4. Edge cases: k being 1 (smallest sum), k being the maximum possible (nm), matrix with only one row, or matrix with only one column. The constraint k <= min(200, nm) is important.
5. Time and space complexity: The time complexity is approximately O(m * k * log(k)) due to sorting within the loop, or O(m * k * n) if naively generating sums and sorting. Space complexity is O(k) to store the intermediate sums.
