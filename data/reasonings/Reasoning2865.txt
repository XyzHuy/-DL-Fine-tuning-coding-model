1. Problem summary: Find the maximum sum of tower heights that can form a mountain shape (non-decreasing then non-increasing) by removing some bricks.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Dynamic Programming, Monotonic Stack.
3. Step-by-step approach: For each potential peak element, calculate the maximum sum of heights to its left (non-decreasing towards the peak) and to its right (non-increasing away from the peak) using a monotonic stack. The total sum for a peak is the sum of left, right, minus the peak element itself (as it's counted twice). The overall maximum is the maximum of these sums over all possible peaks.
4. Edge cases: An array with a single element can be considered a mountain. The peak can be at the beginning or end of the array. All elements might be the same height.
5. Time and space complexity: O(n) time and O(n) space.
