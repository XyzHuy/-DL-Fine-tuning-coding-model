1. Problem summary: Count elements in arr1 for which no element in arr2 is within distance d.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Brute Force, Array Traversal.
3. Step-by-step approach: Iterate through each element of arr1. For each element, check if all elements in arr2 are farther than d. If so, increment the distance count.
4. Edge cases: Empty arrays are not possible due to constraints. d=0 needs to be handled correctly.
5. Time and space complexity: O(n*m) time complexity, O(1) space complexity.
