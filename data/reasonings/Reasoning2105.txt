1. Problem summary: Calculate the minimum refills needed by Alice and Bob to water plants from opposite ends, considering their can capacities and refill rules.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Two Pointers, Greedy Approach.
3. Step-by-step approach: Use two pointers, `left` for Alice and `right` for Bob, starting from the ends. Iterate while `left <= right`. In each iteration, check if current water is sufficient for the respective plant; if not, refill and increment refill count. Water the plants and move pointers inwards. Handle the middle plant separately if `left == right`.
4. Edge cases: The case where there is only one plant (`n = 1`).
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(n) because each plant is visited once. Space complexity is O(1) as only a few variables are used.
