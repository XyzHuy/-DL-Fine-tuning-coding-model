1. Problem summary: Find the longest substring within a given string where for every letter present, both its uppercase and lowercase forms exist. Return the earliest occurring longest nice substring, or an empty string if none exists.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: String manipulation, Recursion, Divide and Conquer.
3. Step-by-step approach: If a character is found whose case-swapped counterpart is missing, recursively search the substrings to the left and right of that character. The base case for recursion is when a substring is found to be entirely "nice," meaning all its characters have their counterparts. The longest nice substring found from these recursive calls is returned.
4. Edge cases: Empty input string or a string with only one character, which cannot form a nice substring.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(N^2) in the worst case due to recursive splitting and set operations. Space complexity is O(N) due to recursion depth and set storage.
