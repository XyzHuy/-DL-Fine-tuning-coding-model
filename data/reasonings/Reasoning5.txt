1. Problem summary: Find the longest palindromic substring within a given string s.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Dynamic Programming.
3. Step-by-step approach: Create a 2D boolean array f to store palindrome information. Iterate through substrings, checking for palindrome conditions and updating the longest palindrome found so far.
4. Edge cases: Empty string, single-character string.
5. Time and space complexity: Time O(n^2), Space O(n^2).
