1. Problem summary: Given a list of courses with durations and deadlines, find the maximum number of courses that can be taken without overlapping and respecting deadlines.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Greedy algorithm with a heap (priority queue).
3. Step-by-step approach: Sort courses by their deadlines. Iterate through each course, add its duration to the total time, and push its duration onto a max-heap. If the total time exceeds the course's deadline, remove the longest duration course from the heap. The size of the heap at the end represents the maximum number of courses taken.
4. Edge cases: Empty input list, courses with very short durations, courses with very long durations, tight deadlines.
5. Time and space complexity: Time: O(N log N) due to sorting and heap operations. Space: O(N) for the heap.
