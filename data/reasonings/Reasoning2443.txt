1. Problem summary: Determine if a given non-negative integer can be formed by adding a non-negative integer to its reverse.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Iteration, Number manipulation.
3. Step-by-step approach: Iterate through all possible non-negative integers `i` from 0 up to the given `num`. For each `i`, calculate its reverse. Check if the sum of `i` and its reverse equals `num`. If a match is found, return true. If the loop completes without finding a match, return false.
4. Edge cases: The input `num` can be 0. For `num=0`, `0 + reverse(0)` (which is `0`) equals `0`, so it should return `true`.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(N * log10(N)) due to the loop up to N and string reversal within the loop. Space complexity is O(log10(N)) for storing the string representation of numbers during reversal.
