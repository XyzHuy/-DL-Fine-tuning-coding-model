1. Problem summary: Remove leaf nodes with a specific target value from a binary tree, recursively removing parent nodes if they become leaves with the target value after children are removed.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Tree traversal, Recursion, Post-order traversal pattern.
3. Step-by-step approach: Use a recursive helper function. For each node, first recursively process its left and right children. After children are processed, check if the current node has become a leaf and if its value matches the target. If so, return None to remove it. Otherwise, return the node.
4. Edge cases: An empty tree (root is None), a tree with only one node, all nodes having the target value.
5. Time and space complexity: O(N) time complexity where N is the number of nodes, as each node is visited once. O(H) space complexity where H is the height of the tree, due to the recursion call stack.
