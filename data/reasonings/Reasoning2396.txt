1. Problem summary: Determine if an integer n is strictly palindromic, meaning its representation in every base from 2 to n-2 (inclusive) is a palindrome.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Number theory, Base conversion, Palindrome check.
3. Step-by-step approach: For a given n, iterate through bases from 2 to n-2. For each base, convert n to its string representation. Check if this string representation is a palindrome. If any representation is not palindromic, return false immediately. If all representations are palindromic, return true. However, upon closer inspection, for n > 4, n in base (n-1) is '11', and n in base (n-2) is '12', neither of which are palindromic for n > 4. Thus, only small values of n need careful consideration. The provided solution simply returns False, implying that no n (within constraints) satisfies the condition.
4. Edge cases: The problem constraints state n >= 4. The loop for bases runs from 2 to n-2. If n=4, the loop range is empty. If n=5, the loop is base 2 and base 3. The solution suggests no n is strictly palindromic.
5. Time and space complexity: The naive approach involves converting to multiple bases and checking palindromes, potentially O(n * log n) or O(n * log^2 n). The provided constant time solution implies an observation that n > 4 is never strictly palindromic.
