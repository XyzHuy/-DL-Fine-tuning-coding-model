1. Problem summary: Find the 1-indexed position of the first word in a sentence that has searchWord as its prefix.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: String manipulation, searching.
3. Step-by-step approach: Split the sentence into individual words. Iterate through each word, checking if it starts with searchWord. If a match is found, return the word's 1-indexed position. If no match is found after checking all words, return -1.
4. Edge cases: The searchWord might not be a prefix of any word, or it might be a prefix of multiple words (in which case the earliest index is returned). The sentence or searchWord could be short.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(N*M) where N is the number of words and M is the length of searchWord. Space complexity is O(N) for storing the split words.
