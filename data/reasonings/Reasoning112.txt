1. Problem summary: Given a binary tree and a target sum, determine if there exists a root-to-leaf path whose sum of node values equals the target sum.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Tree traversal, Depth-First Search (DFS), Recursion.
3. Step-by-step approach: Recursively traverse the tree. At each node, subtract the node's value from the target sum. If a leaf node is reached (no children) and the remaining sum is zero, return true. Otherwise, recursively call the function on the left and right subtrees with the updated remaining sum.
4. Edge cases: Empty tree (return false), negative node values, target sum is zero.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(N), where N is the number of nodes in the tree, as we visit each node once. Space complexity is O(H), where H is the height of the tree, due to the recursion stack. In the worst case (skewed tree), H can be N, and in the best case (balanced tree), H is log N.
