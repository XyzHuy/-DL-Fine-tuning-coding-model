1. Problem summary: Find the maximum number of consecutive 1s in a binary array.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Array traversal, iteration.
3. Step-by-step approach: Iterate through the array, maintaining a current count of consecutive 1s and a maximum count. If the current element is 1, increment the current count and update the maximum count. If the current element is 0, reset the current count to 0.
4. Edge cases: Empty array, array with all 0s, array with all 1s.
5. Time and space complexity: Time: O(n), Space: O(1).
