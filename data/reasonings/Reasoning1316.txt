1. Problem summary: Find the count of unique non-empty substrings that are formed by concatenating a string with itself (e.g., "abab" is a + a where a = "ab").
2. Problem type / algorithm category: String manipulation, Substring search, Rolling Hash.
3. Step-by-step approach: Iterate through all possible lengths of the repeating unit 'a'. For each length, iterate through all possible starting positions of the potential echo substring. Use rolling hash to efficiently compare the two halves of the substring. If the hashes match, add the substring to a set to ensure uniqueness.
4. Edge cases: The problem constraints mention text length up to 2000, so very short strings are implicitly handled. The smallest possible repeating unit 'a' has length 1.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(N^2) due to nested loops for length and start index, and constant time hash computation with precomputation. Space complexity is O(N) for storing powers and prefix hashes, and O(N^2) in the worst case for the set of echo substrings.
