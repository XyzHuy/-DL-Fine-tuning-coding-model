1. Problem summary: Calculate the sum of all elements across all possible odd-length subarrays of a given array of positive integers.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Array manipulation, Mathematical analysis (combinatorics).
3. Step-by-step approach: For each element, determine how many odd-length subarrays it belongs to, then add its contribution (element value multiplied by this count) to the total sum. The count of odd-length subarrays for an element at index i is derived from the total number of subarrays it's part of, which is (i+1)*(n-i), and then taking half of that, rounded up.
4. Edge cases: An array with a single element, where only the element itself forms an odd-length subarray. The constraints guarantee a non-empty array.
5. Time and space complexity: O(n) time complexity as we iterate through the array once. O(1) space complexity as we use only a few variables.
