1. Problem summary: The problem asks to detect if a cycle of at least length 4 exists in a 2D grid, where cells in the cycle must contain the same character and adjacent moves are allowed, excluding the immediate previous cell.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Graph traversal, specifically Depth First Search (DFS) for cycle detection in an undirected graph represented by a grid.
3. Step-by-step approach: Iterate through each cell of the grid. If a cell hasn't been visited, start a DFS from it. During DFS, mark the current cell as visited and explore its unvisited neighbors with the same character. If a neighbor is already visited and is not the immediate parent (previous cell), a cycle is found.
4. Edge cases: Empty grid or grid with empty rows. Grid with only one row or one column. Cycles that are shorter than 4 (which are not valid cycles according to the problem definition).
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(m*n) because each cell is visited at most once. Space complexity is O(m*n) for the visited array and the recursion stack in the worst case.
