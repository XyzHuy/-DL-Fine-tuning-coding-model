1. Problem summary: Count all square submatrices composed entirely of ones within a given binary matrix.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Dynamic Programming.
3. Step-by-step approach: Use a DP table where dp[i][j] stores the side length of the largest square ending at (i, j). If matrix[i][j] is 1, dp[i][j] is 1 plus the minimum of its three neighbors (up, left, top-left). Summing all dp[i][j] values gives the total count.
4. Edge cases: Empty matrix or matrix with empty rows.
5. Time and space complexity: O(m*n) time and O(m*n) space, where m and n are the dimensions of the matrix.
