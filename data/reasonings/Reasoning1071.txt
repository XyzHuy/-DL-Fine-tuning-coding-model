1. Problem summary: Find the largest string that divides both input strings str1 and str2, meaning str1 and str2 can be formed by concatenating the divisor string multiple times.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: String manipulation, Greatest Common Divisor (GCD), substring search.
3. Step-by-step approach: Iterate through all possible lengths of the divisor from len(str2) down to 1. Check if the prefix of str2 with the current length divides both str1 and str2. If it does, return that prefix. If no such divisor is found, return an empty string.
4. Edge cases: When no common divisor exists, the function should return an empty string "". Also, consider cases where one string is shorter than the other.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(min(len(str1), len(str2))^2) because of the nested loops (iterating through possible lengths and the divides function which has string comparison). Space complexity is O(1) as we are only storing a few string variables.
