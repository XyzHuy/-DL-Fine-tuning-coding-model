1. Problem summary: The goal is to find the minimum possible length of a string after applying two types of operations: deleting the closest left or right duplicate of a character.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: String manipulation, Set operations.
3. Step-by-step approach: The operations allow for the removal of duplicate characters. Any duplicate character can eventually be removed by pairing it with another instance of the same character. Therefore, the minimal length is achieved when only unique characters remain. The length of the minimized string is the count of unique characters.
4. Edge cases: An empty string is not possible due to constraints (1 <= s.length). A string with all unique characters initially will have its length unchanged. A string with all same characters will be reduced to length 1.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(N) to build the set, where N is the length of the string. Space complexity is O(K) where K is the number of unique characters (at most 26 for lowercase English letters).
