1. Problem summary: Calculate the minimum cost to start at any city, travel to another city to buy an apple, and return to the starting city, where return travel cost is multiplied by k.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Graph traversal, Shortest Path (Dijkstra's algorithm).
3. Step-by-step approach: Build an adjacency list graph. For each city, run Dijkstra's to find shortest paths to all other cities. For each starting city, iterate through all possible apple buying cities, calculate total cost (apple cost + round trip travel cost * k), and find the minimum.
4. Edge cases: Graph can be disconnected. n can be up to 1000. Costs can be large.
5. Time and space complexity: Time: O(N * (E log V + V)) for N Dijkstra runs. Space: O(V + E) for graph and distances.
