1. Problem summary: Find the maximum gcd-sum (sum * gcd of elements) of any subarray with at least k elements.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Brute Force / Sliding Window with GCD calculation.
3. Step-by-step approach: Iterate through all possible start indices. For each start, consider subarrays of size k. Then, expand the subarray by including subsequent elements one by one. In each step, update the current GCD and sum, and calculate the gcd-sum, keeping track of the maximum found so far.
4. Edge cases: Subarray of exactly k elements, subarrays extending to the end of the array, arrays where all elements are the same.
5. Time and space complexity: O(n^2 * log(max(nums))) time due to nested loops and GCD calculation, O(1) space.
