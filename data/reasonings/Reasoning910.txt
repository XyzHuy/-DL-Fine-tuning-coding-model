1. Problem summary: Given an array of integers, for each number, either add k or subtract k. Find the minimum possible difference between the maximum and minimum values of the modified array.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Sorting, greedy algorithm.
3. Step-by-step approach: Sort the array. Iterate through the sorted array. For each element, consider adding k to all elements before and including the current one, and subtracting k from all the remaining elements. Calculate the max and min of the modified array in each iteration and update the result with the minimum difference found so far.
4. Edge cases: Empty array, single element array. When k is 0, the result is the initial range.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(n log n) due to sorting. Space complexity is O(1).
