1. Problem summary: Calculate the number of pairs of houses (i, j) for each possible shortest path distance k, given n houses connected linearly and a special connection between houses x and y.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Graph traversal (specifically Breadth-First Search - BFS) to find shortest paths.
3. Step-by-step approach: For each house as a starting point, perform a BFS to find the shortest distance to all other houses, considering both linear connections and the special x-y connection. Increment the count for the corresponding distance in the result array.
4. Edge cases: Houses x and y can be the same. The special connection can be between adjacent houses or houses far apart. n can be small.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(N*(N+M)) where N is the number of houses and M is the number of edges. Since M is at most N, it's O(N^2). Space complexity is O(N) for storing distances and the queue during BFS.
