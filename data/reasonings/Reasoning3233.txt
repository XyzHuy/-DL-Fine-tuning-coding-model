1. Problem summary: The task is to count numbers in a given range [l, r] that are NOT "special". A number is special if it has exactly two proper divisors, which means it must be the square of a prime number.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Number theory, counting, optimization.
3. Step-by-step approach: Identify special numbers (squares of primes). Count how many of these special numbers fall within the range [l, r]. Subtract this count from the total number of integers in the range [l, r]. To find squares of primes efficiently, generate primes up to the square root of r using a sieve.
4. Edge cases: The constraints are 1 <= l <= r <= 10^9, so r can be very large. The square root of r will be up to 31622, which is manageable for a sieve. The minimum value for l and r is 1. Special numbers are squares of primes, so 1 is not special and not a square of a prime.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is dominated by the sieve of Eratosthenes up to sqrt(r), which is O(sqrt(r) * log(log(sqrt(r)))). Space complexity is O(sqrt(r)) for storing prime flags.
