1. Problem summary: Remove duplicate elements from a sorted array in-place, returning the number of unique elements.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Two Pointers.
3. Step-by-step approach: Use a slow pointer to track the index of the last unique element, and a fast pointer to iterate through the array. If a new unique element is found, move the slow pointer and copy the new element to its position.
4. Edge cases: Empty array.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(n), space complexity is O(1).
