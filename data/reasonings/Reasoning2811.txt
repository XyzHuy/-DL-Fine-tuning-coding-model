1. Problem summary: Determine if an array can be recursively split into single-element arrays where each split results in two "good" arrays, defined as having length 1 or a sum greater than or equal to m.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Greedy approach, Array manipulation.
3. Step-by-step approach: For an array of length greater than 2, check if any adjacent pair sums up to at least m. If such a pair exists, it can be split, and the problem effectively reduces to solving for the subarrays. If no such pair exists, it's impossible to make a valid first split.
4. Edge cases: Arrays with length 1 or 2 are always splittable.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(n) due to the single pass, space complexity is O(1) as no extra data structures are used.
