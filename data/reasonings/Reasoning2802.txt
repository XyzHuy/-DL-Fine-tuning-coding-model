1. Problem summary: Find the kth lucky number, which consists only of digits 4 and 7, when listed in lexicographical order.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Binary representation, pattern recognition, constructive algorithm.
3. Step-by-step approach: Determine the length of the kth lucky number by finding n such that 2^n is the first power of 2 greater than or equal to k+1. Then, use the adjusted k to construct the number from left to right, deciding between '4' or '7' based on whether k falls into the first or second half of numbers of the current length.
4. Edge cases: k = 1 (should yield "4"), the constraint k <= 10^9 means the length of the lucky number will be at most around 30.
5. Time and space complexity: O(log k) time to find the length and construct the string, O(log k) space for the result string.
