1. Problem summary: Determine if a ball can roll from a start position to a destination position in a maze, where the ball rolls until it hits a wall.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Graph traversal / Depth-First Search (DFS).
3. Step-by-step approach: Use DFS to explore possible paths. From each position, simulate rolling the ball in all four directions until a wall is hit. If the new position is the destination, return true. Mark visited cells to avoid cycles.
4. Edge cases: The ball might not be able to reach the destination, which should return false. The starting and destination positions are guaranteed to be empty spaces.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(m*n) in the worst case where m and n are dimensions of the maze. Space complexity is O(m*n) due to the visited set and the recursion stack in the worst-case scenario.
