1. Problem summary: Determine if a string can be split into three non-empty palindromic substrings.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: String partitioning, dynamic programming for palindrome checking.
3. Step-by-step approach: Precompute all possible palindromic substrings using dynamic programming. Then, iterate through all possible split points for the first and second substrings, checking if the three resulting substrings are palindromes using the precomputed table.
4. Edge cases: The string length is guaranteed to be at least 3, ensuring three non-empty substrings are possible. All characters are lowercase English letters.
5. Time and space complexity: O(n^2) time for precomputing palindromes and O(n^3) time for checking partitions, leading to an overall O(n^3) time complexity. O(n^2) space complexity for the palindrome table.
