1. Problem summary: Find the maximum number of chunks you can split an array into such that sorting each chunk and concatenating them results in the sorted array. The array contains a permutation of integers from 0 to n-1.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Array manipulation, greedy approach.
3. Step-by-step approach: Iterate through the array, keeping track of the maximum value seen so far. If the maximum value seen so far is equal to the current index, it means we can form a chunk up to this point. Increment the chunk count.
4. Edge cases: Empty array (though the constraint says n >= 1), array already sorted.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(n) because we iterate through the array once. Space complexity is O(1) because we only use a few extra variables.
