1. Problem summary: Remove a star and the nearest preceding non-star character in a string until no stars remain.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Stack-based string manipulation.
3. Step-by-step approach: Iterate through the string, pushing non-star characters onto a list (acting as a stack). When a star is encountered, pop the last character from the list if it's not empty. Finally, join the remaining characters in the list to form the result.
4. Edge cases: String containing only stars, string with no stars, string where all characters are removed.
5. Time and space complexity: O(N) time because each character is processed at most twice (once when appended and possibly once when popped). O(N) space for the result list.
