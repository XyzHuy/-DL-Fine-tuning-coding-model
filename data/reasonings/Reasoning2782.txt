1. Problem summary: Count the number of distinct categories among n elements, using a provided handler to check if two elements share a category.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Graph traversal / Union-Find related problem, employing a greedy approach with set to track unique categories.
3. Step-by-step approach: Initialize an empty set to store representative elements for each unique category found. Iterate through each element from 0 to n-1. For each element, check if it belongs to any of the categories already represented in the set using the haveSameCategory method. If it does not match any existing category, add the current element as a representative of a new unique category to the set. Finally, return the size of the set.
4. Edge cases: n = 1 (single element, single category), all elements in the same category, all elements in different categories.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(n*k) where k is the number of unique categories, as each element might be compared with all existing unique categories. In the worst case, k can be n, leading to O(n^2). Space complexity is O(k) or O(n) in the worst case, for storing unique category representatives in the set.
