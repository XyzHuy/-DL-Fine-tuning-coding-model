1. Problem summary: Repeatedly replace adjacent non-coprime numbers in an array with their LCM until no such pairs exist.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Stack-based processing, number theory (GCD, LCM).
3. Step-by-step approach: Iterate through the input numbers, maintaining a stack. For each number, check if it forms a non-coprime pair with the top of the stack. If so, repeatedly pop the stack, update the current number with the LCM of the popped element and the current number, and recalculate the GCD until the GCD is 1 or the stack is empty. Then, push the current number onto the stack.
4. Edge cases: Empty input array, array with only coprime numbers, array where all numbers need to be merged.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity O(N*log(max_val)), Space complexity O(N) where N is the length of nums.
