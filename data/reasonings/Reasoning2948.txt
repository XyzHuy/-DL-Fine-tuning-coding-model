1. Problem summary: Rearrange an array by swapping elements if their absolute difference is within a given limit, aiming for the lexicographically smallest possible array.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Sorting and Grouping (or Connected Components on an implicit graph).
3. Step-by-step approach: Pair each number with its original index, sort these pairs by number value. Iterate through the sorted pairs, identifying contiguous groups where adjacent numbers have a difference less than or equal to the limit. Within each group, sort the original indices and assign the smallest numbers from the group to these sorted indices to achieve the lexicographically smallest arrangement for that segment.
4. Edge cases: Array with a single element, all elements already sorted, no possible swaps due to large limit differences between elements.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is dominated by sorting, O(N log N), where N is the length of the array. Space complexity is O(N) for storing indexed numbers and the result array.
