1. Problem summary: Given an integer array, find the number of arithmetic subsequences of length at least 3.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Dynamic Programming
3. Step-by-step approach: Use a list of dictionaries `dp` where `dp[i][diff]` stores the number of arithmetic subsequences ending at index `i` with difference `diff`. Iterate through each pair of indices `(i, j)` with `j < i`. Calculate the difference `diff = nums[i] - nums[j]`. Update `dp[i][diff]` by adding `dp[j][diff] + 1`. Add `dp[j][diff]` to the `count`.
4. Edge cases: Integer overflow when calculating the difference between numbers. The length of the arithmetic subsequence should be at least 3.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(n^2), where n is the length of the input array. Space complexity is O(n*m), where n is the length of the input array, and m is the number of distinct differences. In the worst case, the space complexity could be O(n^2).
