1. Problem summary: Determine if a deck of cards can be partitioned into groups of size x > 1, where each group contains cards with the same number.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Array manipulation, Greatest Common Divisor (GCD).
3. Step-by-step approach: Count the frequency of each card in the deck. Then, find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of all the frequencies. If the GCD is greater than 1, a valid partition exists.
4. Edge cases: Empty deck, deck with only one type of card, deck where GCD of counts is 1.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(N + KlogK) where N is the length of the deck and K is the number of unique cards, mainly due to counting and calculating GCD. Space complexity is O(K), for storing counts of unique cards.
