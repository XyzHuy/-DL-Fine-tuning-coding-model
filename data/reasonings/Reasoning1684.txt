1. Problem summary: Count how many strings in a given list `words` are "consistent", meaning they only contain characters present in the `allowed` string.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: String manipulation, Set operations, Iteration.
3. Step-by-step approach: Create a set of allowed characters for efficient lookups. Iterate through each word in the `words` list. For each word, check if every character within it is present in the `allowed_set`. If all characters are allowed, increment a counter. Finally, return the total count.
4. Edge cases: An empty `words` list should result in a count of 0. Words containing characters not in `allowed` should not be counted. An empty `allowed` string means no word can be consistent unless it's also empty (which is not allowed by constraints).
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(N*M) where N is the number of words and M is the average length of a word, plus O(L) for creating the allowed set (L is length of allowed). Space complexity is O(L) for the allowed set.
