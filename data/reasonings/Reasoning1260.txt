1. Problem summary: The problem asks to simulate shifting a 2D grid k times, where elements move right, wrap around rows, and the last element wraps to the beginning.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Array manipulation, Simulation.
3. Step-by-step approach: Flatten the 2D grid into a 1D list, perform the cyclic shift on the 1D list by taking the last k elements and prepending them, then reconstruct the 2D grid from the shifted 1D list.
4. Edge cases: k can be larger than the total number of elements, so we take k modulo the total elements. If k becomes 0 after modulo, no shift is needed.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(m*n) for flattening, shifting, and rebuilding. Space complexity is O(m*n) for the flattened list.
