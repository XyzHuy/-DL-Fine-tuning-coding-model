1. Problem summary: Find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the minimum and maximum elements in a given integer array.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Number Theory, Array Manipulation.
3. Step-by-step approach: First, find the smallest and largest numbers in the input array. Then, compute the GCD of these two numbers using a standard GCD algorithm (like Euclidean algorithm).
4. Edge cases: The array will always have at least two elements. The smallest and largest numbers could be the same if all elements are identical.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is dominated by finding the min/max elements and the GCD calculation. Space complexity is O(1) as only a few variables are used.
