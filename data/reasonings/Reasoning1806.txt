1. Problem summary: Given an even integer n, simulate a specific permutation operation repeatedly on an initial permutation (0 to n-1) and find the minimum non-zero operations to return to the initial state.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Simulation, Cycle detection (implicitly).
3. Step-by-step approach: Start with the initial permutation. In a loop, create a new permutation `arr` based on the given rules using the current `perm`. Increment an operation counter. Update `perm` to `arr`. If `perm` equals the initial state, break the loop and return the counter.
4. Edge cases: The smallest possible n is 2. The problem guarantees n is even. The loop termination condition handles all valid n.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(n*k) where k is the number of operations, and k can be related to n. Space complexity is O(n) for storing permutations.
