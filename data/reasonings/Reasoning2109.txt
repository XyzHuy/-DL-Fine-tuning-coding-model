1. Problem summary: Given a string and a list of indices, insert a space before each character at the specified indices.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: String manipulation, array traversal.
3. Step-by-step approach: Iterate through the input string. Maintain a pointer to the current space index. If the current character's index matches the space index, append a space to the result and advance the space pointer. Always append the current character to the result. Finally, join the result list into a string.
4. Edge cases: Spaces at the beginning of the string (index 0), no spaces, all characters having spaces before them.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(N) where N is the length of the string, as we iterate through it once. Space complexity is O(N) for storing the result string.
