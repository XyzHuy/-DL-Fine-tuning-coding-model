1. Problem summary: Reorder a singly linked list in-place to the pattern L0 → Ln → L1 → Ln-1 → L2 → Ln-2 → …
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Linked list manipulation, middle node finding, list reversing, merging.
3. Step-by-step approach: Find the middle of the linked list. Reverse the second half of the linked list. Merge the first and reversed second halves.
4. Edge cases: Empty list, list with only one element, list with two elements.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(N) because we traverse the list to find the middle, reverse the second half, and then merge the two lists. Space complexity is O(1) because the operations are performed in-place.
