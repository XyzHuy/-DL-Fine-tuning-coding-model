1. Problem summary: Given an integer n, find the number of confusing numbers between 1 and n (inclusive). A confusing number is a number that becomes a different valid number when rotated 180 degrees.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Backtracking, Number theory
3. Step-by-step approach: Use backtracking to generate all possible valid numbers using the digits 0, 1, 6, 8, and 9. For each generated number, check if it is within the given range [1, n] and if it is a confusing number (i.e., its rotated value is different from the original). Use a helper function `is_confusing` to determine whether a number is confusing. Initialize a counter to 0 and increment it each time a valid confusing number is found. Start the backtracking by considering the valid digits (1, 6, 8, 9) as the first digit to avoid leading zeros.
4. Edge cases: The input number `n` can be as large as 10^9. Need to handle leading zeros carefully. Also, need to avoid integer overflow when generating the rotated number.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is difficult to determine precisely due to the backtracking nature, but it is roughly O(5^k) where k is the number of digits in n. Space complexity is O(k) due to the recursion depth.
