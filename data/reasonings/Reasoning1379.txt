1. Problem summary: Find the corresponding node in a cloned binary tree given a target node from the original tree.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Tree Traversal (Depth-First Search - DFS).
3. Step-by-step approach: Perform a synchronized DFS on both the original and cloned trees. When the current node in the original tree matches the target node, return the corresponding node from the cloned tree.
4. Edge cases: An empty original tree (no nodes), or the target node being the root.
5. Time and space complexity: Time O(N) where N is the number of nodes, Space O(H) where H is the height of the tree due to recursion stack.
