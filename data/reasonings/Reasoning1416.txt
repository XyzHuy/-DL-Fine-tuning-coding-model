1. Problem summary: Count the number of valid arrays that could form a given digit string, where each element is between 1 and k, with no leading zeros.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Dynamic Programming.
3. Step-by-step approach: Use DP where dp[i] represents the number of ways to form the suffix of s starting at index i. Iterate backwards, building numbers from s[i] onwards. If a number is valid (<= k), add dp[j+1] to dp[i].
4. Edge cases: Leading zeros in the string s, numbers exceeding k, empty string (handled by base case).
5. Time and space complexity: O(N*logK) time due to inner loop capped by length of k as a number, O(N) space for DP table.
