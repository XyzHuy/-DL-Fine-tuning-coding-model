1. Problem summary: Calculate the sum of two integers without using the + or - operators.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Bit manipulation.
3. Step-by-step approach: Use bitwise operators to simulate addition. Calculate the carry and sum without carry in a loop until the carry becomes zero. Handle 32-bit integer overflow by using a mask.
4. Edge cases: Negative numbers, potential overflow beyond 32-bit integers.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(1) since the loop runs at most 32 times. Space complexity is O(1).
