1. Problem summary: Given a shuffled list of numbers that are the result of combining two arrays, 'lower' and 'higher', which were formed by subtracting and adding a constant 'k' to an original array 'arr', reconstruct the original array 'arr'.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Array manipulation, brute-force with optimization, constructive algorithm.
3. Step-by-step approach: Sort the input 'nums'. Iterate through possible values of 'k' by considering pairs of numbers from the sorted 'nums', specifically `nums[i]` and `nums[0]`. For each potential 'k', attempt to construct the original array 'arr' by checking if `num + k` can form a valid 'arr' element such that `num` is in 'lower' and `num + 2*k` is in 'higher' (and both are present in the input). Use a counter to track frequencies. If a valid 'arr' of size n/2 is formed, return it.
4. Edge cases: k must be positive. The difference between `nums[i]` and `nums[0]` must be even to yield an integer k. The input array size is always even and at least 2. Duplicate numbers in the input array need careful handling using counts.
5. Time and space complexity: O(N^2 log N) time due to sorting and iterating through N elements for each of the N possible k candidates, with O(N) for counter operations within the loop. O(N) space for the counter and the result array.
