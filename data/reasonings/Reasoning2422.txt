1. Problem summary: The goal is to find the minimum operations to make an array of positive integers a palindrome by repeatedly merging adjacent elements.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Two pointers, greedy approach.
3. Step-by-step approach: Use two pointers, one from the start and one from the end. If elements match, move pointers inward. If the left element is smaller, merge it with its right neighbor and increment operations. If the right element is smaller, merge it with its left neighbor and increment operations.
4. Edge cases: An empty or single-element array is already a palindrome (0 operations). Array where all elements need to be merged into a single element.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(N) due to the single pass with two pointers. Space complexity is O(1) as we modify the array in-place or use a few variables.
