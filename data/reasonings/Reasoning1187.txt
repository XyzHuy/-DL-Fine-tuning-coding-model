1. Problem summary: Given two integer arrays, find the minimum number of operations to make the first array strictly increasing by replacing elements with elements from the second array.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Dynamic Programming, Binary Search
3. Step-by-step approach: Sort the second array. Use recursion with memoization (lru_cache) to explore two options: either keep the current element of the first array (if it's greater than the previous element) or replace it with the smallest element in the second array that's greater than the previous element (using binary search). The base case is when we've processed all elements in the first array, at which point we return 0.
4. Edge cases: If it is impossible to make the first array strictly increasing, return -1.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(n * m * log(m)) where n is the length of arr1 and m is the length of arr2. Space complexity is O(n*m) due to memoization.
