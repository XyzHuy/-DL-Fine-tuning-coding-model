1. Problem summary: Find a valid path in a city graph of the same length as a target path, minimizing edit distance between city names in the path and target path names.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Dynamic Programming on Graphs.
3. Step-by-step approach: Build an adjacency list for the graph. Use dynamic programming where dp[i][j] stores the minimum edit distance to reach city j at step i of the target path. The transition involves considering neighbors from the previous step. Reconstruct the path by backtracking using a path table.
4. Edge cases: The graph is connected. Cities can have duplicate names. The target path can be long. The path can revisit cities.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(L * N * D) where L is targetPath length, N is number of cities, D is average degree of cities. Space complexity is O(L * N) for DP table and path reconstruction.
