1. Problem summary: Find the maximum value of (a XOR x) * (b XOR x) for 0 <= x < 2^n, modulo 10^9 + 7.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Bit manipulation, Greedy.
3. Step-by-step approach: Iterate through bits from most significant to least significant. Greedily decide whether to flip the current bit in x to maximize the product, considering the current values of (a XOR x) and (b XOR x).
4. Edge cases: n=0 (x=0), a or b can be 0. The constraints on a, b, and n are small.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(n) because we iterate through n bits. Space complexity is O(1) as we only use a few variables.
