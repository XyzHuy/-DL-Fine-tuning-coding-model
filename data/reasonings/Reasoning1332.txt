1. Problem summary: Given a string s consisting only of 'a' and 'b', find the minimum number of steps to make it empty by removing palindromic subsequences.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Greedy, String manipulation.
3. Step-by-step approach: Check if the entire string is a palindrome. If yes, return 1. Otherwise, since only 'a' and 'b' are present, all 'a's form a palindromic subsequence, and all 'b's form another palindromic subsequence. These two can be removed in at most two steps.
4. Edge cases: The string is empty (though constraints say length >= 1), or the string is already a palindrome.
5. Time and space complexity: O(N) time to check for palindrome, O(1) space.
