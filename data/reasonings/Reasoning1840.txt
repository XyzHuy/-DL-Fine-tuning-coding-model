1. Problem summary: Determine the maximum possible height of the tallest building given a set of building height restrictions and adjacency constraints.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Greedy, Dynamic Programming (implicit state propagation).
3. Step-by-step approach: Prepend building 1 with height 0, sort restrictions by building index, enforce height limits by propagating constraints right-to-left and left-to-right, then find the maximum height between adjacent restricted buildings.
4. Edge cases: No restrictions provided, building 1 constraint, last building's height potential.
5. Time and space complexity: O(R log R) time for sorting restrictions, O(R) space for storing modified restrictions, where R is the number of restrictions.
