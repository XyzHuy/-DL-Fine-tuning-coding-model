1. Problem summary: Count the number of contiguous subarrays where the product of elements is strictly less than k.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Sliding window.
3. Step-by-step approach: Iterate through the array using a right pointer. Maintain a product of the current window. If the product is greater than or equal to k, divide by elements from the left until the product is less than k. Increment the count by the size of the current window (right - left + 1).
4. Edge cases: If k is less than or equal to 1, return 0 because no subarray can have a product less than or equal to 0.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(n) because each element is visited at most twice (once by the right pointer and once by the left pointer). Space complexity is O(1).
