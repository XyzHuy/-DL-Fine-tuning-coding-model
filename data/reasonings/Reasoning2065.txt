1. Problem summary: Find the maximum quality of a path starting and ending at node 0, within a given time limit, where quality is the sum of unique node values.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Graph traversal (DFS), backtracking.
3. Step-by-step approach: Use DFS to explore all possible paths from node 0. Maintain current time, current quality, and a set of visited nodes. When returning to node 0, update the maximum quality. Backtrack by removing nodes from the visited set.
4. Edge cases: Graph might not be connected; maxTime could be very small or large; node values can be zero.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is roughly O(N * 4^N) in the worst case due to branching at each node, but practically better due to maxTime constraint and low degree. Space complexity is O(N) for recursion depth and visited set.
