1. Problem summary: Determine if the first player (Alice) wins a game where players remove square numbers of stones from a pile of n stones, with the player unable to move losing.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Dynamic programming, game theory.
3. Step-by-step approach: Use a DP array where dp[i] is true if the current player can win with i stones. Iterate from 1 to n. For each i, check if removing any perfect square k*k (where k*k <= i) leads to a state (i - k*k) where the opponent loses (dp[i - k*k] is false). If such a move exists, dp[i] is true.
4. Edge cases: n=1 (Alice wins by removing 1 stone), n=2 (Alice removes 1, Bob wins), n=4 (Alice wins by removing 4 stones). The constraint n >= 1 covers these.
5. Time and space complexity: Space is O(n) for the DP table. Time is O(n * sqrt(n)) because for each of n states, we iterate up to sqrt(n) possible moves.
