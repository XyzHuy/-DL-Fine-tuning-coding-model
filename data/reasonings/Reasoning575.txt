1. Problem summary: Given an array of candy types, determine the maximum number of unique candy types Alice can eat, given she can only eat n/2 candies.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Array, Hash Set, Greedy
3. Step-by-step approach: Calculate the number of unique candy types using a set. Determine the maximum number of candies Alice can eat (n/2). Return the minimum of the number of unique candy types and n/2.
4. Edge cases: An empty array is not possible based on constraints. Cases where the number of unique candies is greater or smaller than n/2 need to be handled correctly by the min() function.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(n) to create the set. Space complexity is O(n) in the worst case, to store all unique candy types in the set.
