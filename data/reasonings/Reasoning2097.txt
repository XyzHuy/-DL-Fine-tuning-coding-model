1. Problem summary: Rearrange a given list of pairs [starti, endi] such that for any adjacent pairs in the rearranged list, the end of the first pair matches the start of the second pair. A valid arrangement is guaranteed to exist.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Eulerian path in a directed graph.
3. Step-by-step approach: Build a directed graph where numbers are nodes and pairs are edges. Calculate in-degrees and out-degrees. Identify the starting node for the Eulerian path (where out-degree = in-degree + 1, or any node if all degrees are balanced). Traverse the graph using a modified DFS (Hierholzer's algorithm) to find the Eulerian path, storing edges as they are traversed in reverse. Finally, reverse the stored path to get the valid arrangement.
4. Edge cases: All nodes might have equal in-degree and out-degree, in which case any node can be the start. The problem guarantees a valid arrangement exists, so we don't need to handle cases where no Eulerian path is possible.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(N) where N is the number of pairs, due to graph construction and DFS traversal. Space complexity is O(N) to store the graph, degrees, and the result.
