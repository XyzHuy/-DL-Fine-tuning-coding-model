1. Problem summary: Find the minimum number of jumps from the first index to the last index of an array, with allowed moves to adjacent indices or any index with the same value.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Breadth-First Search (BFS).
3. Step-by-step approach: Use BFS to explore possible jumps level by level. Store indices of each value to efficiently find jumps to same-valued elements. Keep track of visited indices to avoid cycles and redundant exploration.
4. Edge cases: Array with a single element (0 jumps), handling boundaries of the array.
5. Time and space complexity: O(N) time complexity because each index and its associated value-based jumps are processed at most once. O(N) space complexity for storing visited indices and the BFS queue.
