1. Problem summary: Determine if two sentences (string arrays) are similar based on word similarity defined by a list of pairs.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: String comparison, set lookup.
3. Step-by-step approach: Check if the sentences have the same length. Create a set of similar word pairs for efficient lookup. Iterate through the sentences, checking if corresponding words are equal or if they are present in the similarity set.
4. Edge cases: Empty similarPairs list, identical sentences, sentences with different lengths, a word is similar to itself.
5. Time and space complexity: Time: O(n + m), where n is the number of words in the sentences and m is the number of similar pairs. Space: O(m) for storing the similar pairs in a set.
