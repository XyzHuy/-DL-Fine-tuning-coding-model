1. Problem summary: Find a subsequence of a given array whose sum is closest to a target goal, minimizing the absolute difference between the subsequence sum and the goal.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Subset sum variation, Meet-in-the-middle, Binary search.
3. Step-by-step approach: Split the array into two halves. Generate all possible subset sums for each half. For each sum from the first half, find the complement sum in the second half (using binary search) that brings the total sum closest to the goal.
4. Edge cases: Empty subsequences (sum of 0), arrays with negative numbers, goal being very large or very small, all numbers being positive or negative.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is roughly O(2^(N/2) * log(2^(N/2))) due to generating subset sums and binary search. Space complexity is O(2^(N/2)) to store the sums.
