1. Problem summary: Compress a string by replacing consecutive runs of the same character (up to 9) with the count followed by the character.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: String manipulation, iterative processing.
3. Step-by-step approach: Iterate through the word, identify consecutive runs of a character, count them up to a maximum of 9, append the count and character to a result list, and repeat until the word is fully processed.
4. Edge cases: The word length constraint is 1 to 2*10^5. Individual characters will have counts between 1 and 9. The word consists only of lowercase English letters.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(N) where N is the length of the word, as each character is visited once. Space complexity is O(N) in the worst case for storing the compressed string.
