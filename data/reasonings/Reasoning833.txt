1. Problem summary: Given a string s and replacement operations (indices, sources, targets), replace substrings of s with corresponding targets if the source string matches the substring at the given index. Replacements must be done simultaneously and cannot overlap.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: String manipulation, pattern matching.
3. Step-by-step approach: Iterate through the indices and sources. Check if each source string occurs at the corresponding index in the original string s. If it does, record the index of the replacement operation. Construct the result string by iterating through s, replacing matched substrings with target strings, and appending unmatched characters as they are.
4. Edge cases: Empty string s, empty indices/sources/targets lists, source string not found at the specified index, index out of bounds (handled by the startswith method).
5. Time and space complexity: Time: O(n + k*m) where n is the length of s, k is the number of replacement operations, and m is the average length of the source strings. Space: O(n) for the auxiliary array d and the result string.
