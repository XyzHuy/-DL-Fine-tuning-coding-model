1. Problem summary: Reorder a singly linked list such that odd-indexed nodes precede even-indexed nodes, maintaining relative order within each group.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Linked list manipulation.
3. Step-by-step approach: Initialize pointers for odd and even nodes. Iterate through the list, rearranging the `next` pointers of odd and even nodes. Connect the end of the odd list to the head of the even list.
4. Edge cases: Empty list, list with only one node, list with only two nodes.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(n) because we iterate through the list once. Space complexity is O(1) because we only use a constant amount of extra space.
