1. Problem summary: Remove all trailing zero characters from a string representing a positive integer.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: String manipulation.
3. Step-by-step approach: Iterate from the end of the string backwards, removing characters as long as they are '0'.
4. Edge cases: The input string might not have any trailing zeros, or it might consist solely of zeros (though the problem statement implies a positive integer, so this specific case of "0" as input is unlikely but a string of "000" is possible and should result in an empty string or "0" depending on interpretation, here "0" is not expected).
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(N) where N is the number of trailing zeros. Space complexity is O(1) if modifying in-place or O(N) for a new string.
