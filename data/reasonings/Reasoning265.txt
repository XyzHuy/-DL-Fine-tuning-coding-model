1. Problem summary: We are given a cost matrix representing the cost of painting n houses with k colors, with the constraint that no two adjacent houses can have the same color. The goal is to find the minimum total cost to paint all houses.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Dynamic Programming. This problem can be solved using dynamic programming to keep track of the minimum cost to paint each house with each color, considering the constraint of adjacent houses having different colors.
3. Step-by-step approach: The solution uses a DP array to store the minimum cost to paint each house up to the current house with a specific color. For each house, the algorithm finds the two minimum costs from the previous house. Then it iterates through the colors and calculates the cost of painting the current house with each color based on the previous minimum costs, making sure that if the current color is the same as the color corresponding to the minimum cost of the previous house, it uses the second minimum cost to avoid painting adjacent houses with the same color.
4. Edge cases: If the input cost array is empty, the minimum cost is 0.
5. Time and space complexity: The time complexity is O(n*k^2) because we iterate through each house and each color and we also find the two min values each time. The space complexity is O(k) because we are using a dp array of length k.
