1. Problem summary: Distribute cookie bags to k children to minimize the maximum total cookies any child receives.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Backtracking (Depth-First Search) with pruning, combined with binary search on the answer.
3. Step-by-step approach: Iterate through possible maximum unfairness values (using binary search). For a given maximum unfairness 'x', use DFS to check if cookies can be distributed such that no child exceeds 'x'. The DFS tries to assign each cookie bag to one of the k children, backtracking if a valid distribution is found for 'x'.
4. Edge cases: k equals cookies.length (each child gets one bag), all cookies can go to one child. The constraints (cookies.length <= 8) suggest an exponential time complexity is acceptable.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is roughly O(k^N * log(Sum)), where N is the number of cookies. Space complexity is O(N + k) for recursion depth and child cookie counts.
