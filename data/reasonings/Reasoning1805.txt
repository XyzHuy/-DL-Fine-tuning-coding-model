1. Problem summary: The task is to count the number of distinct integers present in a given string, after replacing all non-digit characters with spaces and handling potential leading zeros.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: String processing, Set operations, Data type conversion.
3. Step-by-step approach: Iterate through the input string, replacing non-digit characters with spaces. Then, split the modified string by spaces to obtain individual number strings. Convert these number strings to integers (which automatically handles leading zeros) and store them in a set to ensure uniqueness. Finally, return the size of the set.
4. Edge cases: An empty string input (though constraints state length >= 1), strings with only letters, strings with only digits, strings with multiple consecutive non-digit characters.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(N) where N is the length of the word, due to string traversal and splitting. Space complexity is O(N) in the worst case to store the unique numbers.
