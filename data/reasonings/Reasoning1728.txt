1. Problem summary: Determine if the mouse can win a turn-based game on a grid where both cat and mouse can jump, avoiding walls, with win conditions involving catching the mouse, reaching food, or a turn limit.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Game Theory, State-space search, Breadth-First Search (BFS) or Dynamic Programming on states.
3. Step-by-step approach: Model the game as a state (mouse position, cat position, current turn). Use BFS or DP to determine winnable states. Initialize terminal states (food, cat-catches-mouse, turn limit). Propagate win/loss outcomes backwards from terminal states to determine if the initial state is a mouse win.
4. Edge cases: Grid boundaries, walls, initial positions of cat, mouse, and food, maximum jump lengths.
5. Time and space complexity: O((R*C)^2 * 2) for states, O(max_turns) for BFS iterations or DP table size, thus roughly O((R*C)^2) states. Space complexity is O((R*C)^2) to store DP states or visited states.
