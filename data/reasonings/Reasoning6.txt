1. Problem summary: Convert a string into a zigzag pattern with a given number of rows and then read it line by line.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: String manipulation / Array.
3. Step-by-step approach: Create a list of strings representing each row. Iterate through the input string, appending each character to the appropriate row. Manage the direction (down or up) and current row index. Finally, concatenate the rows to produce the result.
4. Edge cases: If numRows is 1, return the original string.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(n), where n is the length of the string. Space complexity is O(n) because we are storing the rows in a list, where in the worst case the string can have all the letters in different rows.
