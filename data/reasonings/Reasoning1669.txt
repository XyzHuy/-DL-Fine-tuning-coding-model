1. Problem summary: Insert list2 between the ath and bth nodes of list1, removing the original nodes from a to b.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Linked List manipulation.
3. Step-by-step approach: Find the node before the ath node, find the node after the bth node, connect the previous node to list2's head, and connect list2's tail to the node after the bth node.
4. Edge cases: The constraints specify valid a and b indices, so no out-of-bounds index issues. List lengths are also within constraints.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(N+M) where N and M are lengths of list1 and list2, space complexity is O(1).
