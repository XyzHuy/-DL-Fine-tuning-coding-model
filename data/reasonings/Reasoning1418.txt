1. Problem summary: The goal is to transform a list of customer orders, each containing customer name, table number, and food item, into a display table. This table should show the count of each food item ordered at each table, with tables sorted numerically and food items alphabetically.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Data processing, aggregation, sorting, and hash map/dictionary usage.
3. Step-by-step approach: First, create a nested dictionary to store food item counts for each table and a set to collect all unique food items. Iterate through the orders, updating the counts in the dictionary and adding food items to the set. Sort the unique food items alphabetically. Then, sort the table numbers numerically. Construct the header row with "Table" and the sorted food items. Finally, iterate through the sorted table numbers, creating a row for each table with its number and the counts of each food item (defaulting to 0 if not ordered), and add this row to the result.
4. Edge cases: An empty `orders` list would result in an empty display table (only header). Tables that haven't ordered certain food items should show a count of 0. Table numbers need to be treated as integers for sorting, even though they are given as strings.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is dominated by sorting food items and table numbers, and iterating through orders and the final table construction, resulting in O(N log N + M log M + T * F), where N is the number of orders, M is the number of unique food items, and T is the number of unique tables, and F is the number of unique food items. Space complexity is O(T * F) to store the counts in the dictionary and O(F) for the set of food items.
