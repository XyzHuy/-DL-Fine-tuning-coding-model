1. Problem summary: Verify if an n x n matrix contains all integers from 1 to n in each row and each column.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Matrix traversal, Set operations.
3. Step-by-step approach: Iterate through each row and use a set to check for duplicate elements and ensure all numbers from 1 to n are present. Simultaneously, transpose the matrix (or use zip to iterate through columns) and perform the same check for each column. If any row or column fails the check, return false.
4. Edge cases: A 1x1 matrix where n is 1 is always valid. The constraints guarantee n is at least 1 and matrix elements are within the [1, n] range.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(n^2) due to iterating through all elements. Space complexity is O(n) for storing elements in a set for each row/column check.
