1. Problem summary: Determine if a subset of positive integers can sum to 1 after each element is multiplied by an integer.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Number Theory, Extended Euclidean Algorithm, GCD.
3. Step-by-step approach: If the greatest common divisor (GCD) of all numbers in the array is 1, then by Bezout's identity, there exist integers x_i such that sum(x_i * nums_i) = 1. This implies the array is "good". Calculate the GCD of all elements.
4. Edge cases: The constraints state positive integers and array length >= 1, so no empty array or zero values. The core logic handles single-element arrays correctly if the element is 1.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(N * log(max(nums))) due to repeated GCD calculations. Space complexity is O(1).
