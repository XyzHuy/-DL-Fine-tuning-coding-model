1. Problem summary: Calculate the final arrival time of a train given its initial arrival hour and a delay in hours, considering a 24-hour format.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Basic arithmetic operations, modulo arithmetic.
3. Step-by-step approach: Add the arrival time and the delayed time. Then, take the result modulo 24 to handle the 24-hour clock wrap-around.
4. Edge cases: The sum of arrivalTime and delayedTime might exceed 23, requiring the modulo operation to correctly represent times like 24:00 as 00:00.
5. Time and space complexity: O(1) time complexity and O(1) space complexity, as it involves a constant number of arithmetic operations.
