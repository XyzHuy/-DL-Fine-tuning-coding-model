1. Problem summary: Delete a node with the given key from a binary search tree and return the modified root.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Binary Search Tree deletion.
3. Step-by-step approach: Recursively search for the node to delete. If found, handle cases: node has no children, one child, or two children. If two children, find the inorder successor (min of the right subtree) to replace the node to be deleted.
4. Edge cases: Empty tree, key not found, node to be deleted is root, node has only left or right child.
5. Time and space complexity: Time: O(H), where H is the height of the tree. Space: O(H) due to recursion stack.
