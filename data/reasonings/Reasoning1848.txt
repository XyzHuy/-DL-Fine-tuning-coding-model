1. Problem summary: Find an index i in nums where nums[i] equals target, such that the absolute difference between i and start is minimized. Return this minimum absolute difference.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Linear search, finding minimum.
3. Step-by-step approach: Iterate through the array, checking each element. If an element matches the target, calculate its absolute distance from the start index. Keep track of the smallest distance found so far.
4. Edge cases: The problem guarantees that the target exists in nums. The array can have duplicate target values, requiring comparison of distances. The start index could be one of the target indices.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(n) because we iterate through the array once. Space complexity is O(1) as we only use a few variables to store the minimum distance.
