1. Problem summary: Given a list of 2D points, find the maximum number of points that lie on the same straight line.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Geometry, line equation, brute force.
3. Step-by-step approach: Iterate through each pair of points. For each pair, count how many other points lie on the same line defined by this pair. Update the maximum count found so far.
4. Edge cases: Empty input list, all points are the same.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(n^3) due to the triple nested loops. Space complexity is O(1).
