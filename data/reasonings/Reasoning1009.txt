1. Problem summary: The task is to flip the bits of an integer's binary representation (0s become 1s, 1s become 0s) and return the resulting integer.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Bit Manipulation.
3. Step-by-step approach: First, create a bitmask that has the same number of bits as the input number, with all bits set to 1. This is done by repeatedly left-shifting the mask and adding a 1 until it has the same length as the input number's binary representation. Then, perform a bitwise XOR operation between the input number and the created mask to flip the relevant bits.
4. Edge cases: The input n = 0 is a special case. Its binary is '0', and its complement is '1'. The main loop for creating the mask does not run for n=0, so this case is handled explicitly.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(log n) because the number of iterations to build the mask is proportional to the number of bits in n. Space complexity is O(1) as it only uses a few variables.
