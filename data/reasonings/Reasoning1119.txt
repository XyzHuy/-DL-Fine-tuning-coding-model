1. Problem summary: Remove all vowels ('a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u') from a given string.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: String manipulation / filtering.
3. Step-by-step approach: Iterate through the input string, and for each character, check if it is a vowel. If it is not a vowel, append it to the result string.
4. Edge cases: Empty input string, string containing only vowels, string containing no vowels.
5. Time and space complexity: Time: O(n), where n is the length of the string. Space: O(n) in the worst case, where the result string contains no vowels.
