1. Problem summary: Find the maximum number of jumps from index 0 to index n-1 in an array `nums`, where a jump from index `i` to `j` is valid if `i < j` and `abs(nums[j] - nums[i]) <= target`.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Dynamic Programming.
3. Step-by-step approach: Initialize a DP array `dp` of size `n` with -1, where `dp[i]` stores the maximum jumps to reach index `i`. Set `dp[0]` to 0. Iterate from index 1 to n-1. For each index `i`, iterate through all previous indices `j` (0 to i-1). If a jump from `j` to `i` is valid (`-target <= nums[i] - nums[j] <= target`) and index `j` is reachable (`dp[j] != -1`), update `dp[i]` to the maximum of its current value and `dp[j] + 1`.
4. Edge cases: The target can be 0, making jumps impossible unless `nums[i] == nums[j]`. If `n-1` is unreachable, the result should be -1. The start index (0) is always reachable with 0 jumps.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(n^2) due to the nested loops. Space complexity is O(n) for the DP array.
