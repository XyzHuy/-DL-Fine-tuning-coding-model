1. Problem summary: Determine the winner (A or B), if it's a draw, or if the game is pending, based on a sequence of moves in a Tic-Tac-Toe game.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Simulation, Game Logic, Array Manipulation.
3. Step-by-step approach: Iterate through the moves in reverse. For each move, update counters for rows, columns, and diagonals based on who made the move (determined by the move index). If any line reaches 3, declare the player who made that move the winner. If all moves are processed and no winner is found, check if all 9 moves were made for a draw or if fewer moves mean the game is pending.
4. Edge cases: Game ends with a winner, game ends in a draw (all 9 moves made with no winner), or game is pending (fewer than 9 moves made and no winner yet).
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(N) where N is the number of moves, as we iterate through the moves once. Space complexity is O(1) as we use a fixed-size array (size 8) to store counts.
