1. Problem summary: Determine if a string can become a palindrome with exactly one or two character changes.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: String manipulation, Two Pointers.
3. Step-by-step approach: Use two pointers, one from the start and one from the end of the string, to count the number of character mismatches. If the count is 0, 1, or 2, return true. If it exceeds 2 at any point, return false.
4. Edge cases: String length 1 (always true, 0 mismatches), string length 2 (can always be made palindrome with 0 or 1 change).
5. Time and space complexity: O(N) time complexity due to single pass through the string, O(1) space complexity as only a few variables are used.
