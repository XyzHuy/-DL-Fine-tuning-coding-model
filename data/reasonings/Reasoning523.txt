1. Problem summary: Given an array of non-negative integers and an integer k, determine if there exists a subarray of size at least two whose sum is a multiple of k.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Hash map, prefix sum, number theory (divisibility).
3. Step-by-step approach: Calculate prefix sums modulo k. Store the remainders and their indices in a hash map. If a remainder repeats, and the distance between the indices is greater than 1, then a subarray with sum divisible by k exists. Initialize the hash map with {0: -1} to handle cases where the prefix itself is divisible by k.
4. Edge cases: k = 0, small arrays, large numbers, the case when the entire array sums to a multiple of k.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(n), where n is the length of the array, as we iterate through the array once. Space complexity is O(min(n, k)) because in the worst case, we may store all n remainders in the hashmap, but the number of distinct remainders modulo k is at most k.
