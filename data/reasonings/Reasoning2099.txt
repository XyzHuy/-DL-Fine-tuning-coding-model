1. Problem summary: Find a subsequence of length k from a given array nums such that the sum of its elements is maximized.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Greedy, Heap (Priority Queue).
3. Step-by-step approach: Store (value, index) pairs. Use a min-heap of size k to track the k largest values encountered so far, popping smaller elements if the heap exceeds size k. After processing all numbers, extract the remaining elements from the heap and sort them by their original index to reconstruct the subsequence in its original relative order.
4. Edge cases: k equals nums.length (return the original array), all numbers are negative, k is 1.
5. Time and space complexity: O(N log k) time for heap operations and O(N) space to store indexed numbers and the heap.
