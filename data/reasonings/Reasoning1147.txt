1. Problem summary: The problem asks to decompose a given string into the maximum number of palindromic substrings, where the substrings are symmetric around the center.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: String manipulation, greedy algorithm.
3. Step-by-step approach: Iterate through the string from both ends (left and right). At each step, build `left_part` from the left and `right_part` from the right. If `left_part` equals `right_part`, it means we have found a palindromic pair, so increment the count by 2 and reset the parts. After the loop, if there is a remaining middle part, increment the count by 1.
4. Edge cases: Empty string (handled implicitly), string with no palindromic decomposition (returns 1), single character string.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(n^2) in the worst case, where n is the length of the string, due to string concatenation. Space complexity is O(n) because of the `left_part` and `right_part` strings storing substring.
