1. Problem summary: Calculate the final value of a variable X, initially 0, after applying a series of increment or decrement operations represented by strings.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Simulation, String manipulation, Basic arithmetic.
3. Step-by-step approach: Initialize X to 0. Iterate through each operation string in the input array. If the string indicates an increment ("++X" or "X++"), add 1 to X. If it indicates a decrement ("--X" or "X--"), subtract 1 from X. Return the final value of X.
4. Edge cases: The input array `operations` can have between 1 and 100 elements. All operations are guaranteed to be one of the four specified types. The initial value of X is always 0.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(N) where N is the number of operations, as each operation is processed once. Space complexity is O(1) as only a single variable X is used for storage.
