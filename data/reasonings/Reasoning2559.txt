1. Problem summary: Count strings in given ranges of an array that start and end with a vowel.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Prefix sums / Binary Search on sorted indices.
3. Step-by-step approach: Precompute a list of indices where words satisfy the vowel condition. For each query [l, r], use binary search on this list to find the count of valid indices within the range [l, r].
4. Edge cases: Empty words list, queries with single elements, all words satisfying the condition, no words satisfying the condition.
5. Time and space complexity: Time O(N + Q log N), Space O(N) where N is number of words and Q is number of queries.
