1. Problem summary: Given a grid of size m x n, find the number of unique paths from the top-left corner to the bottom-right corner, where you can only move down or right.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Dynamic Programming
3. Step-by-step approach: Create a 2D array dp of size m x n. Initialize the first row and first column to 1. For each cell (i, j), the number of paths to reach it is the sum of the paths to reach the cell above it (i-1, j) and the cell to the left of it (i, j-1). The result is stored in dp[m-1][n-1].
4. Edge cases: m = 1 or n = 1, in which case there is only one path.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(m*n), and space complexity is O(m*n).
