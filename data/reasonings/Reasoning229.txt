1. Problem summary: Find all elements in an array that appear more than n/3 times.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Majority element, array manipulation, Boyer-Moore Majority Voting Algorithm.
3. Step-by-step approach: Use a modified Boyer-Moore algorithm to find up to two candidate majority elements. Then, verify if each candidate appears more than n/3 times in the input array by counting.
4. Edge cases: Empty array, array with only one or two elements, cases where there are one or two majority elements.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(N) due to the two passes through the array (one for finding candidates and another for verification). Space complexity is O(1) as we are only using a constant amount of extra space.
