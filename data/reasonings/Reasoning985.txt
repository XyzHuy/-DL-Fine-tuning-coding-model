1. Problem summary: Given an array of integers and a list of queries, where each query updates an element in the array, return a list of the sum of even numbers in the array after each update.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Array manipulation, simulation.
3. Step-by-step approach: Calculate the initial sum of even numbers. Iterate through the queries, and for each query, update the array element and update the even sum accordingly by subtracting the old value if it was even and adding the new value if it is even. Append the updated even sum to the answer.
4. Edge cases: Empty input array, empty queries array, very large or very small numbers.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(n + q), where n is the length of the input array and q is the length of the queries array. Space complexity is O(q) due to storing the result array.
