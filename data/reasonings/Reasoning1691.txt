1. Problem summary: Find the maximum possible height of a stack of cuboids, where a cuboid can be placed on another only if its dimensions are less than or equal to the dimensions of the cuboid below it, and cuboid dimensions can be rearranged.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Dynamic Programming (Longest Increasing Subsequence variant) after preprocessing.
3. Step-by-step approach: First, for each cuboid, sort its dimensions in non-decreasing order to simplify comparisons. Then, sort the cuboids themselves based on their dimensions to ensure that if cuboid `j` can be placed on cuboid `i`, `j` appears before `i` in the sorted list. Use dynamic programming where `dp[i]` stores the maximum height achievable with `cuboid i` at the bottom. Iterate through cuboids, and for each `cuboid i`, initialize `dp[i]` to its own height. Then, iterate through all previous cuboids `j` and if `cuboid j` can be placed below `cuboid i` (i.e., `cuboids[j][dim] <= cuboids[i][dim]` for all dimensions after sorting), update `dp[i]` with `max(dp[i], dp[j] + cuboids[i][2])`. The final answer is the maximum value in the `dp` array.
4. Edge cases: A single cuboid, or cuboids that cannot be stacked on any other cuboid. The sorting handles cases where cuboids have identical dimensions.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(N^2 log N) due to sorting cuboids and then the nested loop for DP, or O(N^3) if sorting dimensions takes O(1) and cuboids are compared in O(1). Space complexity is O(N) for the DP array.
