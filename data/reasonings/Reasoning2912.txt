1. Problem summary: Calculate the number of ways to travel from a source cell to a destination cell in a grid of size n x m in exactly k moves, where a move consists of changing either the row or the column.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Dynamic Programming (with optimized state transitions) or Matrix Exponentiation.
3. Step-by-step approach: Define states representing the number of ways to reach cells in the same row, same column, or different row and column as the current cell, and iterate k times to update these states.
4. Edge cases: Source and destination are the same, grid dimensions n or m are small (leading to fewer valid moves), k=0.
5. Time and space complexity: O(k) time complexity due to k iterations, O(1) space complexity as only a constant number of state variables are maintained.
