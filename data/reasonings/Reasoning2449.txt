1. Problem summary: Transform array nums into target array using operations that add 2 to one element and subtract 2 from another, minimizing operations. Arrays are similar if element frequencies match.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Greedy, Sorting, Simulation.
3. Step-by-step approach: Sort both arrays. The total difference between corresponding elements, when summed and divided by 4, gives the minimum operations because each operation changes the sum of differences by 4.
4. Edge cases: Already similar arrays (zero operations), arrays with identical elements.
5. Time and space complexity: Time O(N log N) due to sorting, Space O(1) or O(N) depending on sort implementation.
