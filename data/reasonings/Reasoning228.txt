1. Problem summary: Given a sorted unique integer array, return a list of strings representing the smallest sorted ranges that cover all numbers exactly.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Array traversal, Range finding.
3. Step-by-step approach: Iterate through the array, maintaining a start and end for the current range. If the current number is consecutive, extend the end. Otherwise, add the current range to the result and start a new range. Handle the last range after the loop.
4. Edge cases: Empty input array. Single element array. Consecutive numbers. Non-consecutive numbers.
5. Time and space complexity: Time: O(n), where n is the length of the input array. Space: O(n) in the worst case where all numbers are non-consecutive.
