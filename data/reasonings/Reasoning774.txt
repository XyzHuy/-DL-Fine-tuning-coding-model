1. Problem summary: Given the locations of gas stations and a number k representing the number of new gas stations to add, find the minimum possible maximum distance between adjacent gas stations after adding the k stations.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Binary search. We are searching for the minimum possible penalty.
3. Step-by-step approach: Use binary search to find the minimum possible penalty. The `possible` function checks if it is possible to achieve a given `max_distance` with at most `k` additional gas stations. If it's possible, try a smaller distance; otherwise, try a larger distance.
4. Edge cases: The initial search space is between 0 and the maximum possible distance (10^8). Need to consider the precision required.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(N log(10^8 / 1e-6)), where N is the number of stations. Space complexity is O(1).
