1. Problem summary: Given a string, count the number of distinct non-empty palindromic subsequences modulo 10^9 + 7.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Dynamic programming.
3. Step-by-step approach: Calculate the next and previous occurrences of each character ('a', 'b', 'c', 'd') for each index. Use dynamic programming to find the number of palindromic subsequences within each substring. If the leftmost and rightmost characters are the same, consider the inner subsequence.
4. Edge cases: No occurrences of a character within a substring, single occurrence, multiple occurrences.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(n^2) and space complexity is O(n^2).
