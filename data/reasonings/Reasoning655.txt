1. Problem summary: Given the root of a binary tree, format the tree into a m x n string matrix, where m is the height of the tree + 1 and n is 2^(height+1) - 1. The root is placed at the center of the top row, and children are placed at calculated positions in the subsequent rows. Empty cells are filled with "".
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Tree traversal, recursion, matrix construction.
3. Step-by-step approach: Calculate the height of the tree. Create an empty matrix of the required dimensions. Define a recursive helper function to place nodes in the matrix based on their row and column position, calculated using the height and row number. Call the helper function starting with the root node at row 0 and the middle column. Return the constructed matrix.
4. Edge cases: Empty tree (should return an empty matrix or a matrix with appropriate dimensions filled with empty strings).
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the tree, as each node is visited and placed in the matrix once. Space complexity is O(m*n), where m is the height + 1 and n is 2^(height+1) - 1, representing the space for the resulting matrix. The recursion stack space is O(height) in the worst case.
