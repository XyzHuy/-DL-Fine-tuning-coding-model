1. Problem summary: Count arrangements of n unique sticks (1 to n) where exactly k sticks are visible from the left.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Dynamic Programming.
3. Step-by-step approach: Use a DP table dp[i][j] representing arrangements of i sticks with j visible. To calculate dp[i][j]: consider the stick of length i. It can be placed at the last position (adding 1 to visible count, requires j-1 visible from i-1 sticks, dp[i-1][j-1] ways), or placed anywhere else (not visible, i-1 positions for it, requires j visible from i-1 sticks, (i-1)*dp[i-1][j] ways).
4. Edge cases: Base case dp[0][0] = 1. k=0 or k>n are implicitly handled by table dimensions and recurrence.
5. Time and space complexity: O(n*k) time to fill the DP table, O(n*k) space for the DP table.
