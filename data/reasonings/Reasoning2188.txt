1. Problem summary: Find the minimum time to complete a specified number of laps, given different tire types with varying lap times and a fixed time cost for changing tires between laps.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Dynamic Programming with optimization (specifically, optimizing the precomputation of consecutive lap times).
3. Step-by-step approach: Precompute the minimum cumulative time for completing up to a limited number of consecutive laps (e.g., 14) with any tire. Use dynamic programming where dp[i] represents the minimum time to complete i laps. Transition involves considering the last block of consecutive laps completed with a single tire and the cost of changing tires before that block.
4. Edge cases: The number of laps can be small; the cost of changing tires can be zero; the initial tire choice matters. The solution correctly handles the fact that no tire change is needed after the final lap.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is dominated by precomputation and DP. Precomputation is O(T * L_max), where T is the number of tire types and L_max is the maximum consecutive laps considered (15). DP is O(N * L_max), where N is numLaps. Overall time is roughly O(T * L_max + N * L_max). Space complexity is O(N) for the DP table and O(L_max) for precomputed best times.
