1. Problem summary: Determine if it is possible to travel from a source to a target within a 10^6 x 10^6 grid, given a list of blocked cells.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Graph traversal / Breadth-First Search (BFS).
3. Step-by-step approach: Convert the blocked list to a set for efficient lookup. Perform BFS from the source to the target, and from the target to the source. Limit the BFS search to a maximum number of steps (area defined by blocked cells) to avoid infinite loops. Return true if both BFS searches reach their respective destinations or expand to the maximum allowed steps, indicating they can escape the blocked area; otherwise, return false.
4. Edge cases: Empty blocked list. Cases where source and target are surrounded by blocked cells. Large number of blocked cells.
5. Time and space complexity: O(B^2) time, where B is the number of blocked cells, due to the BFS potentially visiting all cells within the confined area created by blocked cells and O(B) space for storing the blocked set and visited cells in BFS.
