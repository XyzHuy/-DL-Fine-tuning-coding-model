1. Problem summary: The goal is to find the minimum number of bit flips required to transform an integer 'start' into an integer 'goal'.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Bit manipulation, specifically using XOR and counting set bits.
3. Step-by-step approach: Calculate the bitwise XOR of 'start' and 'goal'. The resulting integer will have a '1' at each bit position where 'start' and 'goal' differ. Then, count the number of set bits (1s) in this XOR result.
4. Edge cases: When start equals goal, the XOR result is 0, and the count of set bits is 0, which is correct. Constraints specify non-negative integers up to 10^9.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(log N) where N is the maximum value of start/goal, due to the XOR operation and counting bits. Space complexity is O(1) as only a few variables are used.
