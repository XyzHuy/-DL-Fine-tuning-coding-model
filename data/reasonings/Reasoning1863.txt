1. Problem summary: Calculate the sum of XOR totals for all possible subsets of a given array of integers.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Backtracking / Recursion for subset generation.
3. Step-by-step approach: Use a recursive backtracking function. The function takes the starting index and the current XOR sum. It adds the current XOR sum to a global result. Then, it iterates through the remaining elements, recursively calling itself with the next index and the XOR sum updated with the current element.
4. Edge cases: The empty subset has an XOR total of 0. The base case of the recursion is when all elements have been considered.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(2^N * N) because there are 2^N subsets and for each subset, we might do N operations in the worst case (though XOR is O(1), the recursive calls explore all paths). Space complexity is O(N) due to the recursion depth.
