1. Problem summary: Find the minimum cost to split an array into subarrays, where the cost of a split is the sum of importance values of subarrays, and importance is k + length of trimmed subarray (elements appearing more than once).
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Dynamic Programming.
3. Step-by-step approach: Use DP where dp[i] is the minimum cost to split the first i elements. To compute dp[i], iterate through all possible split points j (from 1 to i), calculate the trimmed length of the subarray nums[j-1:i], and update dp[i] with the minimum of dp[j-1] + k + trimmed_length.
4. Edge cases: Empty array (not possible by constraints), k=0. The DP initialization handles the base case of an empty prefix.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(n^3) due to nested loops and the inner loop calculating trimmed length. Space complexity is O(n) for the DP array and O(n) for the frequency count within the inner loop.
