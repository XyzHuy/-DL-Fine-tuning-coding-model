1. Problem summary: Determine which recipes can be made given initial supplies and dependencies where recipes can be ingredients for other recipes.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Graph traversal, specifically Topological Sort.
3. Step-by-step approach: Build a directed graph where ingredients point to recipes that use them. Calculate indegrees for each recipe. Initialize a queue with available supplies. Process the queue by decrementing indegrees of dependent recipes and adding newly creatable recipes to the queue and result.
4. Edge cases: Recipes with no ingredients, no supplies available, circular dependencies (though problem constraints imply this is handled by the graph construction and processing).
5. Time and space complexity: O(R * I + S) for time and O(R * I + S) for space, where R is the number of recipes, I is the total number of ingredients across all recipes, and S is the number of supplies.
