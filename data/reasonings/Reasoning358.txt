1. Problem summary: Rearrange a given string such that identical characters have at least a distance k between them. Return an empty string if this rearrangement is impossible.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Heap, greedy algorithm, string manipulation.
3. Step-by-step approach: Use a max heap to store the frequency of each character. Greedily pick the most frequent character, append it to the result, and decrement its frequency. Use a queue to keep track of characters that have been used in the last k positions. When a character is k positions away, add it back to the heap if its frequency is still greater than 0.
4. Edge cases: If k is 0, the string can always be rearranged, return the original string. If the rearranged string length is not equal to the original string length, return an empty string.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(n log n) due to heap operations. Space complexity is O(n) for the heap and queue.
