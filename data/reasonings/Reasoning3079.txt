1. Problem summary: Calculate the sum of numbers where each number is transformed by replacing all its digits with the largest digit present in that number.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Iteration and String manipulation.
3. Step-by-step approach: Iterate through each number in the input array. For each number, find the largest digit within it. Construct a new number by repeating this largest digit as many times as the original number had digits. Sum up all these newly constructed numbers.
4. Edge cases: Numbers with a single digit (they remain unchanged). Numbers where all digits are the same. The constraint on input values (positive integers up to 1000) limits the complexity of digit extraction.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(N*K) where N is the number of elements in nums and K is the maximum number of digits in an element. Space complexity is O(K) for string conversions.
