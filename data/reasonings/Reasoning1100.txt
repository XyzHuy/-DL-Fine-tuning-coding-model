1. Problem summary: Count the number of substrings of length k in a given string s that contain no repeated characters.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Sliding window, String manipulation.
3. Step-by-step approach: Use a sliding window of size k to iterate through the string. In each iteration, check if the characters within the window are unique using a hash map (dictionary). If they are, increment the count.
4. Edge cases: If k is greater than the length of s, return 0.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(n) where n is the length of s. Space complexity is O(k) due to the hash map storing at most k characters.
