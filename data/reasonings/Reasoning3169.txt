1. Problem summary: Count the number of available work days within a given range that do not have any scheduled meetings, considering potential overlapping meetings.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Interval merging and counting.
3. Step-by-step approach: Sort the meetings by start day, then iterate and merge overlapping or adjacent meetings into consolidated intervals. Calculate the total days covered by these merged intervals and subtract this from the total available days.
4. Edge cases: No meetings, meetings that cover all days, meetings that start on day 1 or end on the last day, and meetings that are adjacent but not overlapping.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is dominated by sorting meetings, O(N log N), where N is the number of meetings. Space complexity is O(N) in the worst case for storing merged meetings.
