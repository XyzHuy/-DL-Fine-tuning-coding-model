1. Problem summary: The problem asks to count the total number of pairs that can be formed by removing two equal elements from a given integer array, and the number of elements remaining after forming as many pairs as possible.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Frequency counting / Hash Map (Dictionary)
3. Step-by-step approach: Count the occurrences of each number. For each number, divide its count by 2 to find the number of pairs, and take the remainder modulo 2 to find the leftover elements. Sum these up to get the total pairs and total leftovers.
4. Edge cases: Empty input array (though constraints say length >= 1), array with all unique elements, array with all identical elements.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(N) due to iterating through the array once to count frequencies and then iterating through the unique elements' counts. Space complexity is O(U) where U is the number of unique elements, for storing counts.
