1. Problem summary: Determine the number of ways to select a subset of students such that each student is happy based on whether they are selected and the total number selected compared to their threshold `nums[i]`.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Greedy, Sorting, Combinatorics.
3. Step-by-step approach: Sort the `nums` array. Check the case where zero students are selected. Iterate through possible counts of selected students (from 1 to n) and for each count, check if all students are happy. A student `i` (in sorted `nums`) is happy if `selected_count > nums[i]` when selected, or `selected_count < nums[i]` when not selected. The condition simplifies to checking if `selected_count > nums[i]` and `selected_count < nums[i+1]` (if `i+1` exists).
4. Edge cases: The case where no students are selected. The case where all students are selected. The constraints on `nums[i]` values relative to `nums.length`.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(N log N) due to sorting, and space complexity is O(1) or O(N) depending on the sorting implementation's auxiliary space.
