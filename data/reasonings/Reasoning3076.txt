1. Problem summary: Find the shortest, lexicographically smallest substring for each input string that does not appear in any other input string.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: String manipulation, substring generation, frequency counting.
3. Step-by-step approach: First, generate all possible substrings from all input strings and count their global occurrences. Then, for each input string, iterate through its substrings, check their global counts, and identify the shortest and lexicographically smallest unique substring.
4. Edge cases: Strings where no unique substring exists; strings with multiple unique substrings of the same minimum length.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(N*L^3) and space complexity is O(N*L^2), where N is the number of strings and L is the maximum length of a string.
