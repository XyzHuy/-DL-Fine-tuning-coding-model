1. Problem summary: Find the number of triplets in a given array whose sum is less than a given target value.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Two Pointers, Sorting.
3. Step-by-step approach: Sort the input array. Iterate through the array, fixing the first element of the triplet. Use two pointers, one at the next element and one at the end, to find pairs that satisfy the condition. If the sum is less than the target, increment the count by the number of elements between the two pointers and move the left pointer. Otherwise, move the right pointer.
4. Edge cases: Empty array or array with fewer than 3 elements.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(n^2) due to the nested loops. Sorting takes O(n log n), but is dominated by the nested loops. Space complexity is O(1) if sorting is done in place, otherwise O(n).
