1. Problem summary: Determine if it's possible to disconnect a binary matrix by flipping at most one cell (0 to 1 or 1 to 0), given that paths can only move down or right, and the start (0,0) and end (m-1, n-1) are always 1.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Graph traversal (DFS/BFS), Dynamic Programming.
3. Step-by-step approach: First, count the total number of paths from (0,0) to (m-1, n-1) using DP. If there are no paths or exactly one path, we can potentially disconnect the grid. If there's only one path, we then try to find a single cell (not start/end) to flip to disconnect it by performing a DFS/BFS after each flip. A shortcut is checking if flipping (0,1) or (1,0) disconnects the path.
4. Edge cases: The start and end cells (0,0) and (m-1,n-1) cannot be flipped. The grid might be disconnected initially. The grid might have only one valid path.
5. Time and space complexity: Time: O(m*n) due to DP and DFS/BFS traversals. Space: O(m*n) for DP table and visited array/recursion stack.
