1. Problem summary: Find all starting indices `i` in string `s` where substring `a` matches `s[i..i+len(a)-1]` and there exists another starting index `j` where substring `b` matches `s[j..j+len(b)-1]` such that the absolute difference between `i` and `j` is less than or equal to `k`.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: String matching, brute force with optimization.
3. Step-by-step approach: First, find all occurrences of substring `a` and store their starting indices. Then, find all occurrences of substring `b` and store their starting indices. For each index of `a`, iterate through the indices of `b` to see if any satisfy the `|i - j| <= k` condition. If a match is found for an index `i`, add `i` to the result and move to the next index of `a`.
4. Edge cases: Empty string `s`, `a` or `b` not present in `s`, `k` being very large or very small, `a` and `b` overlapping.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is roughly O(N*M), where N is the length of `s` and M is the number of occurrences of `a` or `b` (potentially N in worst case). Space complexity is O(N) for storing indices.
