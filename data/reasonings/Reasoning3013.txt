1. Problem summary: Find the minimum sum of costs (first elements) of k contiguous subarrays, with a constraint that the difference between the start indices of the second and kth subarrays is at most dist.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Sliding window with a data structure for maintaining order statistics.
3. Step-by-step approach: Initialize the minimum cost with the first element of nums. Consider the first k-1 elements after the first element of nums (up to index dist) to form the initial sum of costs for the subsequent k-1 subarrays. Then, use a sliding window of size dist+1 to iterate through the array, maintaining the sum of the smallest k-1 elements within the window using a sorted list data structure, and updating the minimum total cost.
4. Edge cases: The constraint k-2 <= dist <= n-2 ensures that there are always enough elements to select k-1 elements for the subsequent subarrays within the allowed distance, and that k is always at least 3. The first element of nums is always part of the cost.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(N log K) due to operations on the sorted list within the sliding window. Space complexity is O(dist) to store elements in the sorted list.
