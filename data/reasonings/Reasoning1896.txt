1. Problem summary: Given a boolean expression string with '0', '1', '&', '|', '(', ')', find the minimum operations (flip a bit or operator) to change the expression's final evaluation to 0.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Expression evaluation with optimization, dynamic programming on expression trees or recursive evaluation with memoization.
3. Step-by-step approach: Recursively evaluate subexpressions within parentheses. For each subexpression, determine its evaluated value and the minimum cost to flip that value. Combine results of subexpressions using operators, calculating the cost to achieve a target outcome (0 or 1) based on current values and operator types.
4. Edge cases: Single digit expressions, expressions with only one operator, and nested parentheses structures.
5. Time and space complexity: The provided solution has a time complexity that is likely O(N^2) due to substring operations and repeated traversals. Space complexity is O(N) for the recursion stack and intermediate storage.
