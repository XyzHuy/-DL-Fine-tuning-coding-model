1. Problem summary: Determine if it's possible to obtain 24 from four given numbers (1-9) using +, -, *, / and parentheses.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Backtracking, permutations, arithmetic expression evaluation.
3. Step-by-step approach: Generate all possible permutations of the input numbers. For each permutation, try all possible pairs of numbers and all four arithmetic operations. Recursively solve the resulting smaller set of numbers until a single number is left. Check if this number is approximately equal to 24.
4. Edge cases: Division by zero, floating point precision errors (checking for approximate equality).
5. Time and space complexity: O(n! * 4^(n-1)) time complexity, where n is the number of cards (4), due to permutations and operation choices. O(n) space complexity due to recursion depth.
