1. Problem summary: Group numbers from 1 to n by the sum of their digits, and return the count of groups that have the maximum size.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Counting, Hashing, Simulation.
3. Step-by-step approach: Iterate through numbers from 1 to n. For each number, calculate the sum of its digits. Use a hash map (dictionary) to store the count of numbers for each digit sum (group size). Find the maximum group size. Finally, count how many groups have this maximum size.
4. Edge cases: n = 1 (single group, size 1, count 1). The constraint 1 <= n <= 104 ensures n is positive and within a reasonable range.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(N * log10(N)) due to iterating through N numbers and calculating digit sum which takes logarithmic time. Space complexity is O(log10(N)) for storing group sizes, as the maximum sum of digits for numbers up to 10^4 is relatively small.
