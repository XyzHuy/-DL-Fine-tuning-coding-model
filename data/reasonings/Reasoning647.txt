1. Problem summary: Count the number of palindromic substrings within a given string.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: String manipulation, dynamic programming (although the given solution doesn't explicitly use DP, it shares the characteristic of solving overlapping subproblems).
3. Step-by-step approach: Iterate through the string, considering each character as a potential center of a palindrome. Expand around each center (both for odd and even length palindromes) and count the number of palindromes found.
4. Edge cases: Empty string (although the problem statement specifies the length is at least 1), single-character string, string with all same characters.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(n^2) due to the nested loops (outer loop iterates through each character, inner loop expands around the center). Space complexity is O(1) as it uses constant extra space.
