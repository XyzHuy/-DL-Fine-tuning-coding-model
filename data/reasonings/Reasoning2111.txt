1. Problem summary: The goal is to find the minimum operations to make an array K-increasing, meaning arr[i-k] <= arr[i] for all valid i. An operation involves changing any element to any positive integer.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: This problem can be categorized as Dynamic Programming and related to finding the Longest Non-decreasing Subsequence (LNDS). Specifically, it involves applying LNDS to independent subsequences.
3. Step-by-step approach: Iterate k times, each iteration processing elements at indices i, i+k, i+2k, etc., forming a subsequence. For each subsequence, calculate the length of its Longest Non-decreasing Subsequence (LNDS). The number of operations for that subsequence is its total length minus the LNDS length. Sum these operations across all k subsequences.
4. Edge cases: An empty input array or k being equal to the array length. If k=1, the problem reduces to making the entire array non-decreasing. If an array is already K-increasing, the output should be 0.
5. Time and space complexity: The time complexity is O(N log N) where N is the length of arr, due to processing N elements and performing binary search (log N) for each. The space complexity is O(N) in the worst case for storing subsequences and the `tails` array within the LNDS function.
