1. Problem summary: Given a string of 'I' and 'D' representing increasing and decreasing relationships, find the number of valid permutations of integers from 0 to n that satisfy the given relationships.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Dynamic Programming. This problem requires counting the number of valid permutations, making DP a suitable approach.
3. Step-by-step approach: Use a 2D DP array where dp[i][j] stores the number of valid permutations of length i+1 ending with the j-th smallest number. Initialize the base case (permutations of length 1). Iterate through the string s and fill the DP table. If s[i] == 'D', sum all valid permutations of length i ending with a number greater than the current. If s[i] == 'I', sum all valid permutations of length i ending with a number smaller than the current. The result is the sum of the last row of the DP table. Use modulo operation to prevent overflow.
4. Edge cases: The input string `s` can be of length 1. Also, the result may be very large, thus modulo operation needs to be applied.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(n^2) due to the nested loops in the DP calculation. Space complexity is O(n^2) to store the DP table.
