1. Problem summary: Rearrange an array of 2n elements, given as [x1, x2, ..., xn, y1, y2, ..., yn], into the form [x1, y1, x2, y2, ..., xn, yn].
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Array manipulation, list comprehension, slicing, zipping.
3. Step-by-step approach: Split the input array into two halves: the first n elements (x's) and the next n elements (y's). Then, interleave elements from these two halves to form the new array.
4. Edge cases: The problem constraints guarantee n is at least 1, so the array is never empty and always has an even number of elements.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(n) due to slicing and zipping. Space complexity is O(n) for creating the new list.
