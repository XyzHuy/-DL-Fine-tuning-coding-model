1. Problem summary: Find all ancestors for each node in a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG). An ancestor is a node that can reach the current node.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Graph Traversal (BFS/DFS), Ancestor Finding.
3. Step-by-step approach: For each node, perform a graph traversal (BFS in the solution) starting from that node to identify all nodes reachable from it, which are its descendants. Record the starting node as an ancestor for each reachable node. Finally, sort the ancestors for each node.
4. Edge cases: Nodes with no ancestors (sources), nodes with no descendants (sinks), empty graph, graph with only one node.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(N * (N + E)) where N is the number of nodes and E is the number of edges, due to N BFS traversals. Space complexity is O(N^2) in the worst case for storing ancestors.
