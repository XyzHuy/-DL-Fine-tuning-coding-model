1. Problem summary: Determine if a given list of strings forms a valid word square, where the kth row and column read the same string.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Array manipulation / String comparison.
3. Step-by-step approach: Iterate through each row and character within the row. For each character, compare it with the corresponding character in the column. Return false if any mismatch is found. If the column index is out of bound or the row index is out of the bound in the column word, return false. If all characters match, return true.
4. Edge cases: Empty input, words with varying lengths, column length exceeds number of rows.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(N*M), where N is the number of words and M is the maximum length of a word. Space complexity is O(1).
