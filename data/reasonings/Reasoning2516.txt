1. Problem summary: Given a string of 'a', 'b', 'c' and an integer k, find the minimum minutes to take at least k of each character by removing from either the left or right end.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Sliding Window, Greedy.
3. Step-by-step approach: First, check if it's even possible to get k of each character by counting total occurrences. If not, return -1. Otherwise, use a sliding window approach. The goal is to find the largest contiguous substring in the middle that can be removed, such that the characters outside this window (taken from ends) satisfy the k requirement for each character. The window expands to the right, and shrinks from the left when the count of any character within the window exceeds the total count minus k for that character. The minimum minutes will be the total string length minus the maximum size of such a removable middle window.
4. Edge cases: The string length is less than 3*k. Any character count less than k makes it impossible. k is 0.
5. Time and space complexity: O(N) time where N is the length of string s, as each character is visited at most twice by the sliding window pointers. O(1) space, as the counter only stores counts for 'a', 'b', and 'c'.
