1. Problem summary: Given a graph with edge subdivisions, find the number of reachable nodes from node 0 within a maximum move limit.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Graph traversal, shortest path, Dijkstra's algorithm.
3. Step-by-step approach: Build the graph with edge weights representing the number of nodes + 1. Use Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest distance from node 0 to all other original nodes. Count the reachable original nodes. Calculate the number of reachable new nodes on each edge based on the remaining moves from the end nodes of each original edge.
4. Edge cases: Disconnected graph, maxMoves is very small, large number of subdivisions.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(E + N log N) where E is the number of edges and N is the number of nodes after subdivisions. Space complexity is O(N + E).
