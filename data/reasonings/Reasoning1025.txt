1. Problem summary: Determine if Alice wins a game where players take turns reducing a number n by a divisor x, with the loser being the one who cannot make a move.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Game theory, mathematical reasoning.
3. Step-by-step approach: The solution recognizes a pattern: Alice wins if the initial number n is even. This is because Alice can always subtract 1 if n is even, making it odd. Bob then has to subtract a divisor from an odd number, resulting in an even number for Alice. Eventually, Bob will be faced with 1 and lose.
4. Edge cases: n = 1 leads to Alice losing immediately since there are no divisors.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(1), and space complexity is O(1).
