1. Problem summary: Given an array of integers, find if there exist two distinct indices i and j such that the absolute difference between nums[i] and nums[j] is at most valueDiff, and the absolute difference between i and j is at most indexDiff.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Sliding window, Sorted Set, Binary Search.
3. Step-by-step approach: Use a sliding window of size indexDiff. Maintain a sorted set of the elements within the window. For each element, check if there exists an element in the sorted set within the valueDiff range using binary search (bisect_left). If such element is found, return true. Otherwise, add the current element to the sorted set and slide the window by removing the element that is outside the indexDiff range.
4. Edge cases: Empty array, indexDiff = 0, valueDiff = 0, large valueDiff, duplicate numbers in the array.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(n log k) where n is the length of the array and k is the indexDiff. Space complexity is O(k) where k is the indexDiff, due to the space used by the sorted set.
