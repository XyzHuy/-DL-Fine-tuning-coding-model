1. Problem summary: Find pairs (i, j) with i < j where nums[i] equals nums[j] and their index product (i * j) is divisible by k.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Brute Force, Counting.
3. Step-by-step approach: Iterate through all possible pairs of indices (i, j) such that i < j. For each pair, check if the values at these indices are equal (nums[i] == nums[j]). If they are equal, check if the product of their indices (i * j) is divisible by k. If both conditions are met, increment a counter.
4. Edge cases: Array with no repeating elements, k = 1 (all index products divisible by 1).
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(n^2) due to nested loops. Space complexity is O(1) as only a few variables are used.
