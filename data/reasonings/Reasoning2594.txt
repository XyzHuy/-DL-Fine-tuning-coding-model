1. Problem summary: Find the minimum time to repair a given number of cars by mechanics with different ranks, where a mechanic with rank r repairs n cars in r * n^2 minutes.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Binary Search on the Answer.
3. Step-by-step approach: Use binary search on the possible time values. For a given time 't', check if all cars can be repaired. This check involves summing up the cars each mechanic can repair within time 't' (calculated as sqrt(t / rank)) and seeing if the total meets the required 'cars'. Adjust the search range based on this check.
4. Edge cases: Minimum cars is 1, minimum rank is 1. Upper bound of binary search needs to be large enough to encompass the maximum possible time.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(N * log(max_time)), where N is the number of mechanics and max_time is the maximum possible repair time. Space complexity is O(1).
