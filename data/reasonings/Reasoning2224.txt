1. Problem summary: Given two times in "HH:MM" format, find the minimum operations to transform the first to the second by adding 1, 5, 15, or 60 minutes at a time.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Greedy algorithm, Time conversion.
3. Step-by-step approach: Convert both times to total minutes. Calculate the difference. Greedily use the largest possible operation (60, then 15, then 5, then 1) to reduce the difference, summing up the counts.
4. Edge cases: The problem guarantees current <= correct, so no negative difference. Times can be the same, resulting in 0 operations.
5. Time and space complexity: O(1) for both time and space as the number of operations and calculations are fixed regardless of input time values.
