1. Problem summary: Find the maximum Manhattan distance from a water cell (0) to the nearest land cell (1) in a grid.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Breadth-First Search (BFS)
3. Step-by-step approach: Initialize a queue with all land cells. Perform BFS, expanding from land cells to adjacent water cells, incrementing distance at each level. Mark visited water cells as land to avoid revisiting.
4. Edge cases: If there's no land or no water, return -1.
5. Time and space complexity: Time: O(N^2), Space: O(N^2), where N is the dimension of the grid.
