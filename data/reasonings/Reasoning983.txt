1. Problem summary: Given travel days and ticket costs for 1, 7, and 30 days, find the minimum cost to travel on all given days.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Dynamic Programming.
3. Step-by-step approach: Use a DP array to store the minimum cost up to each day. If a day is not a travel day, the cost is the same as the previous day. If it is a travel day, consider the cost of buying a 1-day, 7-day, or 30-day pass and take the minimum.
4. Edge cases: Ensure that the day - duration is not negative by using max(0, day - duration).
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(N), where N is the last travel day. Space complexity is O(N), for the DP array.
