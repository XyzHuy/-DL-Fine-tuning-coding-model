1. Problem summary: Find the maximum area of a square that fits within the overlapping region of any two given rectangles.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Brute Force, Geometric Intersection.
3. Step-by-step approach: Iterate through all unique pairs of rectangles, calculate their intersection rectangle, determine the largest square that fits within this intersection, and keep track of the maximum square area found.
4. Edge cases: No intersection between any pair of rectangles, resulting in a maximum area of 0.
5. Time and space complexity: O(n^2) time complexity due to nested loops checking all pairs, O(1) space complexity as only a few variables are used.
