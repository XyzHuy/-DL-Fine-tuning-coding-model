1. Problem summary: Generate an array nums of length n+1 based on specific rules, starting with nums[0]=0 and nums[1]=1, and then for indices 2*i and 2*i+1, derive their values from previous elements, and finally return the maximum value in the generated array.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Dynamic programming, array generation.
3. Step-by-step approach: Initialize an array of size n+1 with zeros. Set nums[0] to 0 and nums[1] to 1. Iterate from i=2 up to n. If i is even, nums[i] is nums[i//2]. If i is odd, nums[i] is nums[i//2] + nums[i//2 + 1]. After filling the array, return the maximum element in nums.
4. Edge cases: n=0, where the array is [0] and the max is 0. n=1, where the array is [0,1] and the max is 1.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(n) because we iterate through the array once to generate it. Space complexity is O(n) to store the generated array.
