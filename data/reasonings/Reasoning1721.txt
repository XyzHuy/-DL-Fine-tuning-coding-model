1. Problem summary: Swap the values of the kth node from the beginning and the kth node from the end in a singly linked list.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Linked List Traversal.
3. Step-by-step approach: Traverse the list once to find the kth node from the beginning. Then, use two pointers: one that advances k steps ahead and another that starts from the beginning. When the first pointer reaches the end, the second pointer will be at the kth node from the end. Finally, swap the values of these two identified nodes.
4. Edge cases: The list can be empty, or k can be 1 or equal to the length of the list. The dummy node approach simplifies handling these scenarios.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(n) due to a single pass through the linked list. Space complexity is O(1) as only a few extra pointers are used.
