1. Problem summary: Find the maximum number of points a valid square centered at the origin, with axis-parallel edges and no duplicate tags within it, can contain.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Brute force, Geometry, Iteration, Set.
3. Step-by-step approach: Iterate through each point. For each point, consider the smallest square centered at the origin that encloses it. Then, count how many points are within this square without having duplicate tags. Keep track of the maximum count found.
4. Edge cases: Points on the boundary of the square are considered inside. A square of side length zero is allowed. All points might have the same tag.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(N^2) due to nested loops iterating through points. Space complexity is O(N) for storing point tags and used tags.
