1. Problem summary: Calculate the sum of fractions given as a string, and return the result as an irreducible fraction string.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: String parsing, arithmetic, number theory (GCD).
3. Step-by-step approach: Parse the string to extract numerators and denominators along with their signs. Calculate a common denominator (LCM, though the code uses multiplication initially) and accumulate the numerators accordingly. Finally, simplify the fraction by dividing both numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor (GCD).
4. Edge cases: The expression might start with a digit; handle positive and negative signs correctly; the resulting fraction must be irreducible.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(N + log(M)), where N is the length of the input string and M is the product of denominators. Space complexity is O(1), excluding the output string.
