1. Problem summary: Count strings in a given range [left, right] of an array that start and end with a vowel.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Array traversal, String manipulation, Conditional counting.
3. Step-by-step approach: Iterate through the words array within the specified range [left, right]. For each word, check if its first character is a vowel AND its last character is a vowel. Increment a counter if both conditions are true. Finally, return the total count.
4. Edge cases: The input range [left, right] could be a single element. Words could be single characters. The array could be empty (though constraints prevent this).
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(N) where N is the number of words in the range [left, right], due to iterating through the subarray. Space complexity is O(1) as only a counter variable is used.
