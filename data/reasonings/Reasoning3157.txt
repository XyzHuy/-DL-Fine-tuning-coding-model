1. Problem summary: Find the level in a binary tree with the smallest sum of node values, returning the lowest level in case of a tie.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Tree Traversal (Level Order Traversal / Breadth-First Search).
3. Step-by-step approach: Use BFS to traverse the tree level by level. Maintain the current level sum and compare it with the minimum sum found so far. Update the minimum sum and the corresponding level if a smaller sum is encountered.
4. Edge cases: An empty tree (root is None) should be handled. The root is at level 1.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(N) where N is the number of nodes, as each node is visited once. Space complexity is O(W) where W is the maximum width of the tree, due to the queue used in BFS.
