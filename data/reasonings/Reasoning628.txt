1. Problem summary: Find the maximum product of three numbers in a given integer array.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Array manipulation, sorting.
3. Step-by-step approach: Sort the array. Calculate the product of the three largest numbers and the product of the two smallest numbers and the largest number. Return the maximum of these two products.
4. Edge cases: Array with negative numbers, array with all positive numbers, array with zeros. The problem statement ensures a minimum array length of 3 and value constraints.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(n log n) due to sorting. Space complexity is O(1) as sorting is done in place or uses a small constant amount of extra space.
