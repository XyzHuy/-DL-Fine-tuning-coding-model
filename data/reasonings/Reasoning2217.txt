1. Problem summary: Find the k-th smallest positive palindrome of a given length.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Number theory, constructive algorithms.
3. Step-by-step approach: Determine the structure of a palindrome based on its length. Calculate the first half of the palindrome. Construct the full palindrome by mirroring the first half (adjusting for odd/even lengths).
4. Edge cases: Queries that result in palindromes exceeding the maximum possible value for the given length.
5. Time and space complexity: O(N*L) time, O(N) space where N is the number of queries and L is the intLength.
