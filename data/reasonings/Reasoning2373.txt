1. Problem summary: Create a new matrix where each element is the maximum value from a 3x3 subgrid in the original matrix, centered at the corresponding position.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Matrix traversal, brute force, sliding window maximum.
3. Step-by-step approach: Iterate through each possible top-left corner of a 3x3 subgrid in the input matrix. For each 3x3 subgrid, find the maximum element. Store this maximum in the corresponding cell of the result matrix.
4. Edge cases: The smallest possible input matrix size is 3x3, ensuring that at least one 3x3 subgrid can be extracted. The problem constraints guarantee n is at least 3.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(n^2 * k^2) where k=3 (subgrid size), effectively O(n^2). Space complexity is O((n-2)^2) for the result matrix, effectively O(n^2).
