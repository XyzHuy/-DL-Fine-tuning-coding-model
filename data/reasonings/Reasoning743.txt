1. Problem summary: Find the minimum time for a signal to reach all nodes in a network, starting from a given node. Return -1 if not all nodes are reachable.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Graph, shortest path, Dijkstra's algorithm.
3. Step-by-step approach: Build an adjacency list representing the graph. Initialize distances to infinity. Use a priority queue to implement Dijkstra's algorithm, updating distances to neighbors if a shorter path is found. Finally, check if all nodes are reachable by verifying if any distance is still infinity, and return the maximum distance if all nodes are reachable.
4. Edge cases: The graph might be disconnected, making it impossible to reach all nodes. The initial node k might not be able to reach all other nodes.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(E log V) where E is the number of edges and V is the number of vertices. Space complexity is O(V + E) to store the graph and distances.
