1. Problem summary: Calculate the total time for a specific person at index k to buy all their desired tickets, considering they go to the back of the line after each purchase until they are done.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Simulation, Greedy approach, Mathematical calculation based on relative ticket counts.
3. Step-by-step approach: Iterate through each person. For those before or at index k, add the minimum of their ticket count and the ticket count of person k to the total time. For those after index k, add the minimum of their ticket count and (person k's ticket count - 1) to the total time.
4. Edge cases: The person at index k might have the minimum number of tickets. The person at index k might have the maximum number of tickets. All persons might have the same number of tickets.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(n) because we iterate through the array once. Space complexity is O(1) as we only use a few variables.
