1. Problem summary: Minimize character changes to partition a string into k palindromic substrings.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Dynamic Programming, String manipulation.
3. Step-by-step approach: Calculate the minimum changes for all substrings to become palindromes. Use DP where dp[i][j] stores the minimum changes to partition the first i characters into j palindromic substrings, considering all possible split points.
4. Edge cases: k=1 (cost to make the whole string a palindrome), k=n (each character is a palindrome, cost is 0), and cases where a substring cannot be partitioned into k palindromes.
5. Time and space complexity: O(n^3) time for DP table filling and cost calculation, O(nk) space for the DP table.
