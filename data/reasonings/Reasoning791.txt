1. Problem summary: Sort the string s according to the custom order defined by the string order. Characters in s that are not in order can be placed arbitrarily.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: String manipulation, sorting.
3. Step-by-step approach: Create a dictionary mapping characters in `order` to their index. Then sort the string `s` using the dictionary to determine the order. If a character in `s` is not in `order`, assign it a default value (0) so that it comes before other characters. Finally, join the sorted characters back into a string.
4. Edge cases: `order` can be empty, `s` can be empty, `s` contains characters not in `order`.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(N log N) due to the sorting, where N is the length of s. Space complexity is O(1) because the dictionary size is limited to 26 (number of lowercase english letters).
