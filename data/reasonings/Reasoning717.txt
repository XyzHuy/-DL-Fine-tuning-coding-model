1. Problem summary: Determine if the last character in a binary array, encoded with 1-bit (0) and 2-bit (10 or 11) characters, is a 1-bit character. The array always ends with 0.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Array traversal, decoding.
3. Step-by-step approach: Iterate through the array. If the current bit is 1, skip the next bit (two-bit character). Otherwise, move to the next bit (one-bit character). Return true if the index ends up at the second to last position, meaning the last character is a one-bit character.
4. Edge cases: Empty array (not applicable due to problem constraints), single element array [0] (should return true), arrays with consecutive 1s, arrays with mixed 1s and 0s.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(n) because we iterate through the array at most once. Space complexity is O(1) as we only use constant extra space.
