1. Problem summary: Given a sorted array of non-negative integers and a maximum bit, repeatedly find an integer k to maximize the XOR sum of current array elements and k, then remove the last element.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Bit manipulation, Greedy approach.
3. Step-by-step approach: Calculate the XOR sum of all elements. For each query, to maximize the XOR sum with k, iterate from the most significant bit to the least significant bit. If the current bit of the XOR sum is 0, set the corresponding bit in k to 1 to make the resulting bit 1 (and thus maximize the number). If the current bit is 1, set the corresponding bit in k to 0. After finding k, update the XOR sum by XORing it with the last element of the current nums array, and then remove that element.
4. Edge cases: The array can be empty after all removals. The maximumBit can be small, affecting the range of k. All numbers are non-negative and within the maximumBit limit.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(n * maximumBit) due to iterating through bits for each of the n queries. Space complexity is O(n) for storing the results.
