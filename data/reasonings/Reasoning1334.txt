1. Problem summary: Find the city with the minimum number of reachable cities within a given distance threshold, returning the city with the largest index in case of a tie.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Graph algorithms, Shortest Path (specifically Dijkstra's algorithm), Graph traversal.
3. Step-by-step approach: Represent the graph using an adjacency list. For each city, run Dijkstra's algorithm to find shortest paths to all other cities. Count how many cities are within the distance threshold from the current city. Keep track of the city with the minimum count, updating it if a city with the same count but a larger index is found.
4. Edge cases: Graph with only two nodes, disconnected graphs, all distances exceeding threshold. The problem statement constraints ensure n >= 2 and positive weights.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(N * (E log N)) or O(N * (E + N log N)) due to running Dijkstra's from each node. Space complexity is O(N^2) for storing distances or O(N + E) for adjacency list and priority queue.
