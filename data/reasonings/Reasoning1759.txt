1. Problem summary: Count all homogenous substrings in a given string s, returning the count modulo 10^9 + 7.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: String traversal, counting consecutive characters.
3. Step-by-step approach: Iterate through the string, maintaining the current consecutive character count. When the character changes or the string ends, calculate the number of homogenous substrings for the preceding segment using the formula n*(n+1)/2, add it to the total count (modulo 10^9 + 7), and reset the count for the new character.
4. Edge cases: An empty input string should return 0. A string with only one character should be handled correctly by the general logic.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(n) due to a single pass through the string. Space complexity is O(1) as only a few variables are used for tracking counts.
