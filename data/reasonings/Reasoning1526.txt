1. Problem summary: Given a target integer array, find the minimum operations to transform an array of zeros into the target array. An operation consists of choosing a subarray and incrementing all its elements by one.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Greedy approach, single pass.
3. Step-by-step approach: Initialize operations with the first element of target. Iterate from the second element. If the current element is greater than the previous, add the difference to the total operations.
4. Edge cases: Array with a single element. All elements are the same.
5. Time and space complexity: O(N) time, O(1) space.
