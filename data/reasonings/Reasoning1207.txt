1. Problem summary: Determine if the frequency of each distinct number in an array is unique.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Hashing / Counting.
3. Step-by-step approach: Count the occurrences of each number, store the frequencies, and check if the frequencies are all unique.
4. Edge cases: Empty array, array with one element, array with all same elements, array with negative numbers.
5. Time and space complexity: Time: O(n), Space: O(n).
