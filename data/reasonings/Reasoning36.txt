1. Problem summary: Determine if a given 9x9 Sudoku board is valid, considering only filled cells (1-9) and checking for repetition in rows, columns, and 3x3 sub-boxes.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Validation / Constraint Satisfaction
3. Step-by-step approach: Iterate through rows, columns, and 3x3 sub-boxes. For each, filter out empty cells and check if the remaining cells have unique values using a set.
4. Edge cases: Empty board (all cells are '.'), board with only a few filled cells, board with invalid characters.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(1) because the board size is fixed. Space complexity is O(1) because the set size is bounded by the size of the board.
