1. Problem summary: Given an encoded array where each element is the XOR of two adjacent elements in an original permutation of 1 to n (n is odd), reconstruct the original permutation.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Bit Manipulation (XOR properties), Array Reconstruction.
3. Step-by-step approach: Calculate the XOR sum of all numbers from 1 to n. Calculate the XOR sum of elements in the original permutation at odd indices (which can be derived from the encoded array). XOR these two sums to find the first element of the permutation. Then, iteratively reconstruct the rest of the permutation using the XOR property: perm[i+1] = perm[i] XOR encoded[i].
4. Edge cases: The constraints guarantee n is odd and at least 3, and a unique solution exists. No specific edge cases beyond these problem constraints need explicit handling.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(n) due to iterating through the encoded array and calculating XOR sums. Space complexity is O(n) to store the reconstructed permutation.
