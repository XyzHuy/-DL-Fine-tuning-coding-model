1. Problem summary: Sort teams based on votes where higher rank is better, using positional votes and alphabetical order for tie-breaking.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Sorting, custom comparison.
3. Step-by-step approach: Create a count for each team at each position (higher count means better rank), then sort teams using these counts as primary sort keys and team names as secondary keys.
4. Edge cases: Single voter, all votes identical, ties that require alphabetical resolution.
5. Time and space complexity: O(N*M + T*logT) time, O(T*M) space where N is the number of votes, M is the number of teams, T is the number of unique teams.
