1. Problem summary: Determine if a target amount of water can be measured using two jugs with capacities x and y, given fill, empty, and pour operations.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Number theory, Greatest Common Divisor (GCD), Math.
3. Step-by-step approach: Check for edge cases (target is 0 or target is greater than the sum of the jug capacities). Calculate the GCD of x and y. Check if target is a multiple of the GCD.
4. Edge cases: target is 0 (return True), target is greater than x + y (return False).
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(log(min(x, y))) due to the GCD calculation. Space complexity is O(1).
