1. Problem summary: Minimize the time to remove all '1's from a binary string, using operations that remove cars from the left (cost 1), right (cost 1), or anywhere (cost 2).
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Dynamic Programming or Greedy with prefix/suffix sums. The solution uses a DP-like approach with prefix and suffix computations.
3. Step-by-step approach: Calculate the minimum cost to remove all '1's considering only operations from the left end up to each index. Separately, calculate the minimum cost to remove all '1's considering only operations from the right end starting from each index. Finally, iterate through all possible split points, combining the left and right costs to find the overall minimum.
4. Edge cases: An empty string (no '1's) should result in 0 time. A string with all '0's also results in 0 time. A string with a single '1' requires either 1 (if at an end) or 2 (if in the middle) time.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(n) due to three linear passes over the string. Space complexity is O(n) for storing the prefix and suffix costs.
