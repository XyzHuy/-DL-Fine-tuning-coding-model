1. Problem summary: Determine if a 2D path, defined by 'N', 'S', 'E', 'W' movements, revisits any previously occupied coordinate.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Simulation, Set (for visited tracking).
3. Step-by-step approach: Initialize current coordinates to (0,0) and a set of visited coordinates with (0,0). Iterate through the path string, updating coordinates based on the character ('N', 'S', 'E', 'W'). For each new coordinate, check if it's already in the visited set. If so, return True. Otherwise, add the new coordinate to the visited set. If the loop finishes without returning True, return False.
4. Edge cases: An empty path (though constraints say path.length >= 1), paths that immediately return to origin or adjacent points.
5. Time and space complexity: Time O(N), Space O(N) where N is the length of the path.
