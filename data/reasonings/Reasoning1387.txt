1. Problem summary: Find the k-th smallest number in the range [lo, hi] when sorted by their "power" value, which is the number of steps to reach 1 using 3x+1 or x/2 rules. If powers are equal, sort by the number itself.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Sorting, Simulation (Collatz Conjecture steps).
3. Step-by-step approach: Calculate the power for each number in the range [lo, hi], store pairs of (power, number), sort these pairs first by power and then by number, and finally return the number from the k-th pair.
4. Edge cases: The input constraints ensure lo and hi are within a reasonable range (<= 1000), and k is valid. All numbers are guaranteed to reach 1.
5. Time and space complexity: Time is dominated by calculating powers and sorting. Calculating power for each number up to hi can take roughly O(hi * log(hi)) in a loose upper bound, and sorting N=hi-lo+1 elements is O(N log N). Space is O(N) to store the power-value pairs.
