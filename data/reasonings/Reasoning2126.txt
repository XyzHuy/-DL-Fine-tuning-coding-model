1. Problem summary: Determine if a planet can destroy all given asteroids by colliding with them in any order, gaining mass from destroyed asteroids.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Greedy algorithm.
3. Step-by-step approach: Sort asteroids by mass. Iterate, if current planet mass is less than asteroid mass, return false. Otherwise, add asteroid mass to planet mass. If loop completes, return true.
4. Edge cases: Empty asteroid list (implicitly handled by loop), initial planet mass too small for any asteroid.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(N log N) due to sorting, space complexity is O(1) if sorting is in-place or O(N) if a copy is made.
