1. Problem summary: Rearrange rows of a binary grid by adjacent swaps to make all elements above the main diagonal zero, minimizing swaps or returning -1 if impossible.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Greedy, Array Manipulation, Counting.
3. Step-by-step approach: First, count the number of trailing zeros for each row. Then, for each row from top to bottom, find the first row below it that satisfies the required number of trailing zeros. If such a row exists, perform adjacent swaps to bring it to the current row's position and increment the swap count. If no such row is found, the grid is impossible to validate.
4. Edge cases: The grid might be impossible to validate if no row can satisfy the trailing zero requirement for a given position. All rows being identical also presents a challenge if they don't meet the criteria.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(n^3) due to nested loops for finding rows and performing swaps, and space complexity is O(n) for storing trailing zeros.
