1. Problem summary: Maximize happy groups by rearranging their order, where a group is happy if their first customer gets a fresh donut.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Dynamic Programming with Memoization and state compression (using remainders).
3. Step-by-step approach: Calculate remainders of group sizes modulo batchSize. Use a DP state representing current leftover donuts and counts of each remainder. Iterate through possible next groups to serve, updating the state and maximizing happy groups.
4. Edge cases: Groups that perfectly fit a batch (remainder 0) are always happy. Initial state with 0 leftover donuts. All groups processed.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(batchSize * batchSize^batchSize * batchSize), Space complexity is O(batchSize^batchSize * batchSize).
