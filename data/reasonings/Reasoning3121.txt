1. Problem summary: Count letters that appear in both lowercase and uppercase, where all lowercase instances precede all uppercase instances.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: String manipulation, character counting, iteration.
3. Step-by-step approach: Iterate through the string to record the first and last index of each character. Then, for each letter of the alphabet, check if its lowercase and uppercase versions exist and if the last occurrence of the lowercase version is before the first occurrence of the uppercase version.
4. Edge cases: Empty string (though constraints prevent this), string with only lowercase, string with only uppercase, string with interleaved cases where conditions are not met.
5. Time and space complexity: Time O(N) for iteration, O(1) for alphabet checks. Space O(1) for storing first/last occurrences (fixed alphabet size).
