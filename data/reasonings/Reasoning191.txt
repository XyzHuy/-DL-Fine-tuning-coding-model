1. Problem summary: Count the number of set bits (1s) in the binary representation of a given positive integer.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Bit manipulation.
3. Step-by-step approach: Convert the integer to its binary string representation using the built-in `bin()` function, then count the occurrences of the character '1' in the string.
4. Edge cases: The input is constrained to be a positive integer within a specific range (1 to 2^31 - 1), so no explicit edge case handling is needed within that range.
5. Time and space complexity: The time complexity is O(log n) because the length of the binary representation is logarithmic with respect to n. The space complexity is also O(log n) because the binary string requires space proportional to the number of bits.
