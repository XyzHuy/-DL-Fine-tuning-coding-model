1. Problem summary: Find the maximum sum of a subsequence where for any two consecutive elements nums[i] and nums[j] with i < j, the condition nums[j] - nums[i] >= j - i must hold.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Dynamic Programming with Binary Indexed Tree (BIT) / Fenwick Tree, Coordinate Compression.
3. Step-by-step approach: Transform nums[i] to nums[i] - i. Use coordinate compression on these transformed values to map them to smaller ranks. Employ a BIT to efficiently query the maximum sum of a balanced subsequence ending with a value less than or equal to the current transformed value. Iterate through the array, for each element, query the BIT for the maximum sum ending before its transformed value, add the current element to this sum, and update the BIT with this new maximum sum for the current transformed value's rank. The overall maximum sum encountered is the answer. Handle negative numbers by considering the maximum single element if all subsequence sums are negative.
4. Edge cases: An empty input array, all negative numbers in the input array, single element array.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(N log N) due to sorting for coordinate compression and BIT operations. Space complexity is O(N) for storing transformed values, ranks, sorted unique values, and the BIT.
