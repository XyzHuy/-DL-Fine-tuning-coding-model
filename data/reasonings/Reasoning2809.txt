1. Problem summary: Find the minimum time (number of operations) to make the sum of nums1 less than or equal to x, where each second elements in nums1 increment based on nums2, and at each second, one element in nums1 can be reset to 0.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Dynamic Programming, Greedy approach.
3. Step-by-step approach: Sort pairs of (nums1[i], nums2[i]) by nums2[i]. Use DP where dp[k] stores the maximum sum achievable by zeroing out k elements. Iterate through sorted pairs and update DP. Calculate initial total sums. Iterate through possible operation counts k (0 to n) and check if the condition is met using the DP values.
4. Edge cases: If the target sum x cannot be reached even after all operations, return -1. The initial sums of nums1 and nums2 are also important for calculations.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(N^2) due to nested loops in DP, where N is the length of the arrays. Space complexity is O(N) for the DP array.
