1. Problem summary: Given a color in "#RRGGBB" format, find the closest shorthand color "#RGB" where each R, G, and B are formed by repeating a single hex digit. Closeness is defined as minimizing the sum of squared differences between the RR, GG, BB components of the given color and the corresponding shorthand color.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: String manipulation, optimization (finding the closest value).
3. Step-by-step approach: Iterate through the R, G, and B hex value pairs of the input color. For each pair, find the closest shorthand hex value. Construct the shorthand color string. To find the closest shorthand hex value, convert the two-digit hex value to an integer, find the nearest multiple of 17 (since shorthand values are multiples of 0x11), and convert back to a two-digit hex string.
4. Edge cases: The input color string will always be in the correct format. The hex values can range from 00 to ff. The closest shorthand value needs to be represented as a two-digit hex string, padding with a leading zero if necessary.
5. Time and space complexity: The time complexity is O(1) because the input string has a fixed length, and the operations performed on each pair of hex characters take constant time. The space complexity is O(1) as the output string has a fixed length and only constant extra space is used.
