1. Problem summary: Determine if any number in a given integer array appears at least twice.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Array, Hash Set
3. Step-by-step approach: Iterate through the array, adding each number to a set. If a number is already in the set, return true. If the loop finishes without finding a duplicate, return false.
4. Edge cases: Empty array, array with only one element, array with all identical elements.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(n), where n is the length of the array. Space complexity is O(n) in the worst case (no duplicates).
