1. Problem summary: Given an arithmetic expression consisting of numbers and operators (+, -, *), find all possible results by computing the expression in different ways based on different parenthesizations.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Divide and Conquer, Recursion, Dynamic Programming (can be optimized with memoization).
3. Step-by-step approach: The solution uses a recursive approach. The base case is when the expression is a single number, which is directly converted to an integer and returned in a list. Otherwise, the function iterates through the expression, and whenever an operator is encountered, it splits the expression into two sub-expressions (left and right). It then recursively calls itself on the left and right sub-expressions to obtain all possible results for each. Finally, it combines the results from the left and right sub-expressions by applying the operator to all possible pairs of left and right values and appending to the overall results list.
4. Edge cases: Input expression consisting of a single number. Operators are '+', '-', and '*'.
5. Time and space complexity: The time complexity is exponential, roughly O(C(n)), where C(n) is the nth Catalan number because of the recursive calls for all possible parenthesizations. The space complexity is also related to the Catalan number and the length of the expression, influenced by the depth of the recursion and storage of intermediate results, potentially O(C(n)) in the worst case for storing the results.
