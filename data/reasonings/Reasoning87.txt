1. Problem summary: Determine if string s2 is a scrambled version of string s1 according to the defined scrambling algorithm involving splitting, swapping, and recursion.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Dynamic Programming / Recursion with Memoization
3. Step-by-step approach: Use a recursive function with memoization (using @cache) to explore all possible splits and swaps of the strings. The base case is when the length is 1, in which case compare the characters. For lengths greater than 1, iterate through all possible split points and recursively check both scenarios: with and without swapping the substrings.
4. Edge cases: Strings of length 1.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(N^4) due to the memoization and the nested loops. Space complexity is O(N^3) due to the cache storing results for different (i, j, k) combinations.
