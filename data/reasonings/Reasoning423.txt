1. Problem summary: Given a string containing scrambled English representations of digits, reconstruct the digits in ascending order.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: String manipulation, counting, and reconstruction.
3. Step-by-step approach: Count character occurrences. Identify unique characters to determine digit counts. Deduce remaining digit counts. Build the result string based on digit counts.
4. Edge cases: Input string might be empty (though constraints specify length >= 1), input might contain only some of the digits.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(N) where N is the length of the input string, due to character counting and iteration. Space complexity is O(1) since the character counts and digit counts are limited to a fixed size.
