1. Problem summary: Given an integer n, generate all strobogrammatic numbers of length n.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Backtracking, Recursion.
3. Step-by-step approach: Use a recursive depth-first search (DFS) approach. The base cases are n=0 and n=1. For n > 1, recursively generate strobogrammatic numbers of length n-2, and then add pairs ('11', '88', '69', '96') around them. For the case when the current length is not the initial n, also add '0' at both ends.
4. Edge cases: n = 0, n = 1. Also avoid leading zeros except for the single digit "0".
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(5^(n/2)) because each recursion branches into 5 possibilities. Space complexity is O(n*5^(n/2)) to store the strobogrammatic numbers and the call stack.
