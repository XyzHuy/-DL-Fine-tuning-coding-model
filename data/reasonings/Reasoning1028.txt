1. Problem summary: Reconstruct a binary tree from its preorder traversal string, where dashes represent the depth of each node.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Tree traversal, recursion, string parsing.
3. Step-by-step approach: Recursively parse the traversal string. For each node, determine its depth based on the number of leading dashes. Extract the node's value. Recursively construct the left and right subtrees, increasing the depth for each level.
4. Edge cases: Empty traversal string, single node tree, unbalanced tree. The traversal string might end prematurely.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(N), where N is the number of nodes in the tree. Space complexity is O(H), where H is the height of the tree, due to the recursion stack. In the worst case, H can be N.
