1. Problem summary: Given an array of widths for each lowercase letter and a string, determine the number of lines needed to write the string with a maximum width of 100 per line, and the width of the last line.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: String manipulation, greedy algorithm.
3. Step-by-step approach: Iterate through the string, keeping track of the current line's width. If adding the next character exceeds 100, increment the line count and reset the current width to the character's width. Otherwise, add the character's width to the current width.
4. Edge cases: Empty string (shouldn't happen based on constraints), widths array with invalid values (not handled explicitly but assumed to be valid based on constraints).
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(n), where n is the length of the string s. Space complexity is O(1).
