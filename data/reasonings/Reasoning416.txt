1. Problem summary: Determine if an array can be partitioned into two subsets with equal sums.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Dynamic Programming / Subset Sum Problem.
3. Step-by-step approach: Calculate the total sum, if it's odd return false. Otherwise, find if a subset with sum equal to half of total sum exists. Use DP to track reachable sums.
4. Edge cases: Empty array, array with a single element, array where sum is odd.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(n*target), where n is the number of elements and target is half of the total sum. Space complexity is O(target).
