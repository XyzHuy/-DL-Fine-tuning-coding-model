1. Problem summary: Determine if an array of numbers can be rearranged to form an arithmetic progression.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Sorting, Array manipulation.
3. Step-by-step approach: Sort the input array. Calculate the difference between the first two elements. Iterate through the rest of the sorted array, checking if the difference between each consecutive pair matches the initial difference.
4. Edge cases: The problem constraints state that arr.length is at least 2, so an empty array or a single-element array is not a concern.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is dominated by sorting, O(N log N). Space complexity is O(1) if sorting is in-place, or O(N) depending on the sorting algorithm implementation.
