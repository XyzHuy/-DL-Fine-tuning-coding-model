1. Problem summary: Find the minimum number of pushes required to move a box from its initial position to a target location in a grid, where the player can move and push the box.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Breadth-First Search (BFS) on a state space. The state includes the player's position and the box's position.
3. Step-by-step approach: Use BFS to explore possible states. A state is defined by the player's coordinates and the box's coordinates. From a state, explore adjacent states by moving the player. If the player moves to a cell adjacent to the box and can push it to an empty/target cell, that forms a new state. The BFS finds the shortest path in terms of pushes.
4. Edge cases: The target is unreachable, meaning the box cannot be moved to the target location. Obstacles (#) block movement for both the player and the box.
5. Time and space complexity: The state space is (m*n) for player position and (m*n) for box position, resulting in O((m*n)^2) states. Each state exploration involves checking 4 directions. Thus, time complexity is O((m*n)^2). Space complexity is O((m*n)^2) to store visited states and the queue.
