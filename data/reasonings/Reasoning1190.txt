1. Problem summary: Reverse substrings enclosed in matching parentheses, innermost first, and remove all parentheses from the final result.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: String manipulation, stack.
3. Step-by-step approach: Iterate through the string. When an opening parenthesis '(' is encountered, push it onto a stack. When a closing parenthesis ')' is encountered, pop elements from the stack until an opening parenthesis is found. Reverse the popped elements and push them back onto the stack. Finally, join the characters in the stack to form the result.
4. Edge cases: Empty string, single pair of parentheses, nested parentheses.
5. Time and space complexity: O(n^2) time, where n is the length of the string, due to the string reversal. O(n) space for the stack.
