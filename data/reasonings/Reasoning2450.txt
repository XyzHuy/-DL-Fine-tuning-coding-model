1. Problem summary: Given a binary string `s` and an integer `k`, find the number of distinct binary strings obtainable by flipping any substring of length `k` any number of times, modulo 10^9 + 7.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Combinatorics, Bit manipulation.
3. Step-by-step approach: Realize that each flip operation on a substring of length `k` can be independently chosen to be applied or not applied. The number of possible starting positions for a substring of length `k` is `len(s) - k + 1`. Therefore, there are `2^(len(s) - k + 1)` total combinations of operations. Calculate this value modulo 10^9 + 7.
4. Edge cases: `k` is equal to the length of `s`. In this case, there is only one substring of length `k` (the string itself), so the number of distinct strings is 2. The formula `2^(len(s) - k + 1)` correctly handles this (2^(n-n+1) = 2^1 = 2).
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(1) as it only involves simple arithmetic operations. Space complexity is O(1) as no extra space is used.
