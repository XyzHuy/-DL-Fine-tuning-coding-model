1. Problem summary: Find all words in a given list that are substrings of any other word in the same list.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: String manipulation, brute-force comparison.
3. Step-by-step approach: Iterate through each word and compare it against every other word. If the current word is found as a substring within another word, add it to the result list and move to the next word to avoid duplicates.
4. Edge cases: An empty input list or a list with only one word would result in an empty output. No word is a substring of itself in this context due to distinct word comparisons.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(N^2 * L^2) where N is the number of words and L is the maximum length of a word. Space complexity is O(N*L) in the worst case to store the result.
