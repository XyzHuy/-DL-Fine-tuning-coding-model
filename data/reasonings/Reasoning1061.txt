1. Problem summary: Given two strings s1 and s2 of equal length defining character equivalencies, find the lexicographically smallest equivalent string of baseStr.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Union-Find (Disjoint Set Union)
3. Step-by-step approach: Use Union-Find to group equivalent characters. Initialize each character as its own parent. Iterate through s1 and s2, unioning corresponding characters. For each character in baseStr, find its representative (root) in the Union-Find structure. If a character in baseStr is not present in s1 or s2, keep it as it is. Concatenate the representative characters to form the result.
4. Edge cases: Empty strings, characters in baseStr not present in s1 or s2, s1 and s2 having different lengths (though the problem statement specifies equal lengths).
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(n + m), where n is the length of s1 and s2, and m is the length of baseStr, due to the union-find operations and string traversal. Space complexity is O(1), since the character set is limited to lowercase English letters (26 characters max), meaning the size of the parent dictionary is bounded.
