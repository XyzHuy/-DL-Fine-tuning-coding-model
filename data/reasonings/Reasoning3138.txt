1. Problem summary: Given a string s formed by concatenating anagrams of an unknown string t, find the minimum possible length of t.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: String manipulation, factorization, frequency analysis.
3. Step-by-step approach: Iterate through possible lengths `k` that divide the length of `s`. For each `k`, check if `s` can be divided into segments of length `k` such that all segments are anagrams of each other. This check involves comparing character counts of each segment against the overall character counts of `s` scaled by `n/k`. The first `k` that satisfies this condition is the minimum length of `t`.
4. Edge cases: The string `s` itself could be the only anagram (length of `t` equals length of `s`). The shortest possible length for `t` is 1 if all characters in `s` are the same.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(N * sqrt(N)) in the worst case due to iterating through divisors and O(k) for counter comparison within the check function. Space complexity is O(alphabet size) for storing character counts.
