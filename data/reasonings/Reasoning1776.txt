1. Problem summary: Determine the collision time of each car with the car immediately ahead of it, considering fleets form with the slowest car's speed upon collision.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Stack-based simulation, Greedy.
3. Step-by-step approach: Iterate from the last car backwards. Use a stack to store indices of cars potentially involved in future collisions. For each car, pop cars from the stack that are slower or would have already collided by the time the current car would reach them. Calculate collision time for valid preceding cars. Push current car onto the stack.
4. Edge cases: Cars that never collide (handled by initial -1.0 and `while` loop conditions), cars that are slower than the car behind them (will collide), cars that are faster and will overtake (will collide).
5. Time and space complexity: Time O(n) because each car is pushed and popped from the stack at most once. Space O(n) for the stack.
