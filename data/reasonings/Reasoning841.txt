1. Problem summary: Determine if it's possible to visit all rooms given a list of rooms where each room contains keys to other rooms, starting from room 0.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Graph traversal / Depth-First Search (DFS).
3. Step-by-step approach: Start at room 0, use a stack to perform DFS, mark visited rooms, and for each visited room, add unvisited keys found in that room to the stack. Finally, check if the number of visited rooms equals the total number of rooms.
4. Edge cases: Empty input list, rooms containing keys to themselves, a single room containing no keys, disconnected graph.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(N + E), where N is the number of rooms and E is the total number of keys. Space complexity is O(N) due to the visited set and the stack, where N is the number of rooms.
