1. Problem summary: Find the earliest move index in arr that completes a row or column in mat.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Array traversal, Hash Map (Dictionary), Counting.
3. Step-by-step approach: 1. Create a mapping of matrix values to their (row, col) coordinates. 2. Initialize row and column counters. 3. Iterate through arr: for each number, get its position, increment the corresponding row and column counts. 4. Check if row count equals n or column count equals m; if so, return the current index.
4. Edge cases: Matrix dimensions 1x1, arr containing numbers that complete rows/columns very early or late.
5. Time and space complexity: Time O(m*n) for preprocessing matrix, O(m*n) for iterating arr. Space O(m*n) for position map and counters.
