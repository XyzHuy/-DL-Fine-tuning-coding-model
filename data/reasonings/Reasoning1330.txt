1. Problem summary: Calculate the maximum value of an array, where value is sum of absolute differences between adjacent elements, after reversing exactly one subarray.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Array manipulation, greedy approach, optimization.
3. Step-by-step approach: Calculate initial array value. For each potential reversal, calculate the change in value. The change comes from the difference between original adjacent elements and new adjacent elements formed by reversal. Consider reversals starting at index 0, ending at index n-1, and internal reversals. Maximize this change and add to initial value.
4. Edge cases: Array with only two elements (no internal reversal possible that changes adjacent pairs other than ends).
5. Time and space complexity: O(N) time complexity due to single passes through the array, O(1) space complexity as only a few variables are used.
