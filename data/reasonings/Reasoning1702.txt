1. Problem summary: Given a binary string, find the lexicographically largest string achievable by repeatedly replacing "00" with "10" and "10" with "01".
2. Problem type / algorithm category: String manipulation, Greedy approach.
3. Step-by-step approach: Count the total zeros. If more than one zero exists, the goal is to shift all zeros to the right as much as possible, leaving a single zero before the last possible position. The final string will consist of ones, followed by a single zero, followed by the remaining ones. The position of this single zero is determined by the initial count of zeros and the index of the first zero.
4. Edge cases: If the input string contains zero or one zero, no operations can change it to a larger string, so the original string is returned.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(N) due to counting zeros and string construction. Space complexity is O(N) for storing the result string.
