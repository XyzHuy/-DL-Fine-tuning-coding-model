1. Problem summary: Given an integer k, find the minimum operations to make the sum of array elements (initially [1]) at least k, using increment and duplicate operations.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Optimization, Iteration/Brute Force on a key parameter.
3. Step-by-step approach: Iterate through all possible final values 'x' of the single element after increments. For each 'x', calculate the minimum duplications 'n' needed so that n * x >= k. The total operations for 'x' is (x-1) increments + (n-1) duplications. Find the minimum total operations across all 'x'.
4. Edge cases: When k is 1, no operations are needed. The smallest possible 'x' is 1.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(k) because we iterate from 1 to k. Space complexity is O(1) as we use a few variables.
