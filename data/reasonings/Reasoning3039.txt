1. Problem summary: Identify the string state immediately before the final operation that empties the input string `s`, where each operation removes the first occurrence of each character 'a' through 'z' present in the current string.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: String manipulation, frequency analysis, greedy approach.
3. Step-by-step approach: Calculate the frequency of each character. Determine the maximum frequency. Identify characters with this maximum frequency. Iterate backwards through the string, collecting the last seen instance of each character that has the maximum frequency, ensuring no duplicates are added to the result. Finally, reverse the collected characters to form the output string.
4. Edge cases: The input string can contain all unique characters, or all same characters. The string length is at least 1.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(N) due to a single pass for frequency counting and another pass for building the result. Space complexity is O(K) where K is the alphabet size (26) for storing frequencies and seen characters.
