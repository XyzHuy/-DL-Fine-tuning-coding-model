1. Problem summary: Check if concatenating a 3-digit number n with 2*n and 3*n results in a 9-digit string containing digits 1 through 9 exactly once.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: String manipulation and validation.
3. Step-by-step approach: Convert n, 2*n, and 3*n to strings, concatenate them, check if the resulting string has a length of 9, and verify if it contains all digits from '1' to '9' without any '0's.
4. Edge cases: The concatenated number must have exactly 9 digits and must not contain the digit '0'. The input n is guaranteed to be a 3-digit number.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(1) as operations are on fixed-size strings derived from a 3-digit number. Space complexity is O(1) for storing the concatenated string and set.
