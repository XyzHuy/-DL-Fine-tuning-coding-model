1. Problem summary: Given an array of integers and an integer k, find the maximum bitwise OR of all elements after multiplying one element by 2^k.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Bitwise operations, Prefix/Suffix sums (or ORs).
3. Step-by-step approach: Precompute prefix ORs and suffix ORs. For each element, calculate the potential maximum OR by ORing its multiplied value (nums[i] << k) with the prefix OR before it and the suffix OR after it. Keep track of the overall maximum.
4. Edge cases: Array with a single element, k=0 (no operations allowed), all elements being 0.
5. Time and space complexity: Time O(n) due to prefix/suffix calculations and one pass for max OR. Space O(n) for storing prefix and suffix OR arrays.
