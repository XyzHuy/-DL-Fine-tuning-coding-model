1. Problem summary: Find the maximum score by traversing an array from left to right, where scores are added for visited elements and subtracted by x if adjacent visited elements have different parities.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Dynamic Programming.
3. Step-by-step approach: Maintain two DP states: maximum score ending with an even number and maximum score ending with an odd number. Iterate through the array, updating these states based on the current number's parity and potential score deductions.
4. Edge cases: The initial element's parity determines the starting score. The array has at least two elements.
5. Time and space complexity: O(N) time complexity and O(1) space complexity.
