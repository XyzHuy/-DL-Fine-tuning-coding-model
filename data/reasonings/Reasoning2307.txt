1. Problem summary: Given a set of division equations (A / B = value) and their corresponding real number values, determine if there's any contradiction among these equations.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Graph traversal (DFS/BFS) on a directed graph representing relationships between variables.
3. Step-by-step approach: Build a graph where variables are nodes and equations represent directed edges with weights (values). For each equation, verify if the derived value from other equations matches the given value using DFS.
4. Edge cases: Variables not present in the graph, self-loops, disconnected components, and floating-point precision issues.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(E * (V + E)) and space complexity is O(V + E), where V is the number of variables and E is the number of equations.
