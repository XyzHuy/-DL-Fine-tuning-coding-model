1. Problem summary: Given a list of non-negative integers, arrange them to form the largest possible number, returning it as a string.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Sorting, String comparison
3. Step-by-step approach: Convert integers to strings, sort strings using a custom comparator that compares the concatenation of two numbers in both orders (x+y vs y+x), join sorted strings and handle leading zeros.
4. Edge cases: Empty input list, list with only zeros, large numbers requiring string representation.
5. Time and space complexity: Time: O(n log n) due to sorting. Space: O(n) for storing strings.
