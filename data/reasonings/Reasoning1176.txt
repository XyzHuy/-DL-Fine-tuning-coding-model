1. Problem summary: Calculate the total points gained or lost by a dieter based on their calorie consumption over consecutive k-day periods, compared to lower and upper calorie thresholds.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Sliding window, Array manipulation.
3. Step-by-step approach: Initialize points to 0. Calculate the initial sum of the first k days. Iterate through the remaining days, updating the sum using the sliding window technique (adding the new day's calories and subtracting the oldest day's calories). Compare the current sum with lower and upper bounds to update points accordingly. Return the total points.
4. Edge cases: Empty calories array, k equals the length of the calories array, lower equals upper.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(n) due to the single loop. Space complexity is O(1) as we use a constant amount of extra space.
