1. Problem summary: Determine if a string can become a palindrome after removing at most k characters.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Dynamic Programming, Palindrome, String Manipulation.
3. Step-by-step approach: Use dynamic programming to find the length of the longest palindromic subsequence. If the length of the string minus the length of the longest palindromic subsequence is less than or equal to k, the string is a k-palindrome.
4. Edge cases: Empty string (handled implicitly), k = 0 (string must be a palindrome), k >= string length (always true).
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(n^2) due to the nested loops in the dynamic programming approach. Space complexity is O(n^2) for the DP table.
