1. Problem summary: Determine if a given set of 2D points lie on the same straight line.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Geometry / Slope calculation.
3. Step-by-step approach: Calculate the difference in x and y (dx, dy) between the first two points. Then, for every subsequent point, check if the ratio of its y-difference (from the first point) to its x-difference (from the first point) is equal to the initial dx/dy ratio. This is efficiently done using cross-multiplication to avoid division by zero.
4. Edge cases: Arrays with 0, 1, or 2 points are always considered to form a straight line.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(n) where n is the number of points. Space complexity is O(1) as only a few variables are used.
