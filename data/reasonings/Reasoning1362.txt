1. Problem summary: Find two integers with the smallest absolute difference whose product is either num + 1 or num + 2.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Number theory, factorization, brute force with optimization.
3. Step-by-step approach: Iterate downwards from the square root of num + 1 to find its closest divisors. Do the same for num + 2. Compare the absolute differences of the divisor pairs and return the pair with the minimum difference.
4. Edge cases: Small values of num where num+1 or num+2 might be prime or have limited divisors. The maximum value of num is 10^9.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(sqrt(N)) where N is max(num+1, num+2). Space complexity is O(1).
