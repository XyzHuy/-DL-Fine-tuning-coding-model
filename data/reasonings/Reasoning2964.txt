1. Problem summary: Count triplets (i, j, k) with i < j < k such that the sum of elements at these indices is divisible by d.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Brute Force, Combinatorics.
3. Step-by-step approach: Iterate through all possible combinations of three distinct indices (i, j, k) where i < j < k. For each triplet, calculate the sum of nums[i], nums[j], and nums[k]. Check if this sum modulo d is equal to 0. If it is, increment a counter. Finally, return the total count.
4. Edge cases: Array length can be small (minimum 3 for a triplet), or close to 1000. Values in nums and d can be large. All numbers could be multiples of d, or none could form a divisible triplet.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(n^3) due to three nested loops iterating up to n. Space complexity is O(1) as only a few variables are used.
