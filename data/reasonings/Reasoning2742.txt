1. Problem summary: Minimize the cost to paint n walls using a paid painter and a free painter, where the paid painter has specific costs and times, and the free painter paints any wall in 1 unit time for free but can only be used when the paid painter is busy.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Dynamic Programming with Memoization.
3. Step-by-step approach: Define a DP state dp(i, remaining_walls) representing the minimum cost to paint the remaining walls starting from index i. At each step i, either use the paid painter (incurring cost[i] and reducing remaining_walls by time[i]+1) or skip the paid painter and let the free painter handle it later (reducing remaining_walls by 1, effectively). Memoize the results to avoid redundant calculations.
4. Edge cases: When remaining_walls <= 0, the cost is 0. If all walls are considered (i >= n) and remaining_walls > 0, it's impossible, so return infinity.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(n^2) due to the two parameters in the DP state (index and remaining walls, which can go up to n). Space complexity is O(n^2) for the memoization table.
