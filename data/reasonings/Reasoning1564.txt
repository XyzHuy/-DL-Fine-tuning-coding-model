1. Problem summary: Determine the maximum number of boxes that can be placed into warehouse rooms, considering boxes can be rearranged, pushed from left to right, and stopped by rooms shorter than their height.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Greedy algorithm, Two Pointers.
3. Step-by-step approach: Sort boxes ascending. Preprocess warehouse to store minimum height up to each room from the left. Use two pointers, one for boxes (smallest first) and one for warehouse (largest available space first), to greedily fit boxes.
4. Edge cases: Empty boxes or warehouse arrays. All boxes too tall for any room. All rooms too short for any box.
5. Time and space complexity: O(B log B + W) time for sorting boxes and preprocessing warehouse. O(1) or O(B) space depending on whether sorting is in-place.
