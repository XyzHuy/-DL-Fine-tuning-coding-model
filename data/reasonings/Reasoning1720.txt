1. Problem summary: Reconstruct an original array `arr` given its XOR-encoded version `encoded` and the first element `first`.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Array reconstruction, Bitwise operations (XOR).
3. Step-by-step approach: Initialize `arr` with `first`. Iterate through `encoded`, where each `encoded[i]` is `arr[i] XOR arr[i+1]`. To find `arr[i+1]`, use `arr[i+1] = arr[i] XOR encoded[i]`.
4. Edge cases: The problem constraints guarantee `n >= 2`, so `encoded` will have at least one element and `arr` will have at least two elements. No empty array or single element array to consider based on constraints.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(n) as we iterate through the encoded array once. Space complexity is O(n) to store the decoded array.
