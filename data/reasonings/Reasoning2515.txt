1. Problem summary: Find the shortest circular distance from a startIndex to any occurrence of a target string in a circular array of strings.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Array traversal, string matching, circular distance calculation.
3. Step-by-step approach: First, check if the target string exists in the words array. If not, return -1. If it exists, iterate through the array, and for each occurrence of the target string, calculate the distance in both clockwise and counter-clockwise directions from the startIndex, considering the circular nature of the array. Keep track of the minimum distance found.
4. Edge cases: The target string not being present in the array. The startIndex itself being an index where the target string is located.
5. Time and space complexity: O(N) time complexity due to iterating through the array, and O(1) space complexity as only a few variables are used.
