1. Problem summary: Find the maximum total fish catchable by a fisher starting at any water cell and moving to adjacent water cells, collecting all fish from visited cells.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Graph traversal, Depth-First Search (DFS).
3. Step-by-step approach: Iterate through each cell of the grid. If a cell contains fish (is a water cell), start a DFS from that cell. The DFS explores all connected water cells, sums up the fish from each, and marks visited cells as empty (0) to avoid recounting. Keep track of the maximum fish sum found across all starting cells.
4. Edge cases: The grid might contain no water cells, in which case the maximum fish caught is 0. All cells might be land cells (0).
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(m*n) because each cell is visited at most once by the DFS. Space complexity is O(m*n) in the worst case due to the recursion depth of DFS, especially for a grid filled with water.
