1. Problem summary: Given a grid of '/', '\', and ' ' characters, determine the number of regions formed by these slashes.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Disjoint Set Union (DSU), Graph Theory
3. Step-by-step approach: Treat each cell as 4 triangles. Use DSU to connect adjacent triangles within and between cells based on the given characters. Count the number of disjoint sets, which represents the number of regions.
4. Edge cases: Empty grid, grid with only one type of character, backslashes needing to be escaped.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(N^2 * α(N^2)), where N is the length of the grid and α is the inverse Ackermann function (almost constant). Space complexity is O(N^2) for the DSU parent array.
