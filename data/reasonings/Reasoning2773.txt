1. Problem summary: Calculate the height of a special binary tree where leaf nodes form a circular linked list.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Tree traversal (Depth First Search).
3. Step-by-step approach: Perform a Depth First Search (DFS) from the root. For each node, recursively find the height of its left and right subtrees. The height of the current node is 1 plus the maximum height of its children. The final result is the total height from DFS minus 1 (since height is defined as the number of edges on the longest path).
4. Edge cases: An empty tree (root is None) should have a height of -1 (or 0 if defined as number of nodes). A single-node tree has a height of 0. The problem constraints guarantee at least two nodes.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(N) where N is the number of nodes, as each node is visited once. Space complexity is O(H) in the average case and O(N) in the worst case for the recursion stack, where H is the height of the tree.
