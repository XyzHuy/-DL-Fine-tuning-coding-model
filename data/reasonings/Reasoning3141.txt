1. Problem summary: Calculate the maximum Hamming distance between each number in an array and all other numbers in the same array, considering binary representations up to m bits.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Brute Force, String Manipulation, Bit Manipulation (implicitly).
3. Step-by-step approach: Convert each number to its m-bit binary string. For each number, iterate through all other numbers, calculate their Hamming distance by comparing corresponding bits, and keep track of the maximum distance found for that number.
4. Edge cases: The problem constraints ensure nums.length is at least 2, so self-comparison is not an issue. All numbers are within the 0 to 2^m - 1 range.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is O(n^2 * m) due to nested loops and bit comparison. Space complexity is O(n * m) for storing binary strings.
