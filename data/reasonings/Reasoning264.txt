1. Problem summary: Find the nth ugly number, where an ugly number is a positive integer whose prime factors are limited to 2, 3, and 5.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Dynamic programming, specifically finding the nth element in a sequence generated by multiplying previous elements by 2, 3, and 5.
3. Step-by-step approach: Initialize an array with the first ugly number (1). Maintain three pointers, one for each of the prime factors (2, 3, 5). Generate the next ugly number by finding the minimum of the next multiples of 2, 3, and 5. Append this minimum to the array and increment the corresponding pointer(s). Repeat until the array contains n ugly numbers. Return the nth ugly number.
4. Edge cases: The input n is always between 1 and 1690, so no need to worry about zero or negative inputs. The first ugly number is 1, which is already handled in the initialization.
5. Time and space complexity: The time complexity is O(n) because we iterate n times to find the nth ugly number. The space complexity is O(n) because we store n ugly numbers in the array.
