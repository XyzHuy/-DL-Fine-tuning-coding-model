1. Problem summary: Calculate the total score of student answers to a mathematical expression, where points are awarded for correct answers (5 points), answers achievable by prioritizing addition before multiplication (2 points), and 0 points otherwise.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Dynamic Programming or Recursion with Memoization for exploring all possible calculation orders. String parsing and arithmetic evaluation.
3. Step-by-step approach: First, calculate the correct answer by strictly following the given order of operations (multiplication then addition, left to right). Second, generate all possible answers achievable by deviating from the standard order of operations but respecting left-to-right evaluation at each step. This can be done recursively with memoization. Finally, iterate through student answers, awarding points based on matches with the correct answer or the set of possible answers.
4. Edge cases: The expression length, single-digit operands, constraints on the number of operators, and the maximum possible answer value influencing the recursion depth and intermediate results.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is dominated by generating all possible answers. With memoization, it's roughly O(N^3 * M) where N is the length of string and M is max value. Space complexity is O(N^2 * M) due to memoization.
