1. Problem summary: Given a binary string representing an integer, find the number of operations to reduce it to 1 by dividing by 2 if even, and adding 1 if odd.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Simulation, Integer manipulation.
3. Step-by-step approach: Convert the binary string to an integer. Repeatedly apply the rules (divide by 2 for even, add 1 for odd) until the number becomes 1, counting each operation.
4. Edge cases: The input string is guaranteed to start with '1' and have a length between 1 and 500. The case where the input is already "1" (decimal 1) should result in 0 steps.
5. Time and space complexity: Time complexity is proportional to the number of steps, which is roughly logarithmic in the value of the number represented by the string. Space complexity is O(1) as only a few variables are used.
