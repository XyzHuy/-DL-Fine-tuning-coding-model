1. Problem summary: Determine if any element in an integer array is exactly double another element in the same array, ensuring distinct indices.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Hash Set (or Dictionary) for efficient lookups.
3. Step-by-step approach: Iterate through the array, and for each element, check if its double or half (if even) already exists in a hash set of seen elements. If a match is found, return true. Otherwise, add the current element to the hash set. If the loop finishes without finding a match, return false.
4. Edge cases: The presence of zero, negative numbers, and odd numbers requiring checking for divisibility by two. The constraint that i != j is implicitly handled by checking against previously seen elements.
5. Time and space complexity: O(N) time complexity due to single pass through the array, and O(N) space complexity for the hash set.
