1. Problem summary: Insert a pair of parentheses around a subexpression containing a single '+' to minimize the evaluated result. The left parenthesis goes before the '+' and the right goes after.
2. Problem type / algorithm category: Brute Force, String Manipulation, Arithmetic Evaluation.
3. Step-by-step approach: Iterate through all possible split points for the left parenthesis in the left part of the expression and all possible split points for the right parenthesis in the right part. For each combination, calculate the resulting value and track the combination that yields the minimum value. Construct the final string using the best split points.
4. Edge cases: The left parenthesis can be placed immediately before the '+', and the right parenthesis can be placed immediately after the '+'. Also, the left or right parts might be empty strings when forming the outer multiplication factors.
5. Time and space complexity: O(N^3) time due to nested loops and string slicing/integer conversion (length of left/right can be up to N/2, and string operations take O(N)). O(N) space for storing intermediate strings.
