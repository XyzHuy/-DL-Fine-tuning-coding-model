Given a list of integers `nums` of size `n`, return the sum of the two largest integers.

Example:
Input: `nums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`
Output: `9`

Explanation:
The two largest integers are 4 and 5, so the sum is 9.

Constraints:
- `n < 10000`


Boilerplate code:
```python
def sum_of_two_largest(nums):
    ...
